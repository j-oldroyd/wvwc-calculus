Similarly, we want <span class="process-math">\(dv\)</span> to be easy to integrate. And since we’d like to be able to compute this integral, we’d also like <span class="process-math">\(v\,du\)</span> to be simpler than <span class="process-math">\(u\,dv\text{.}\)</span> Now return to <span class="process-math">\(x\sin x\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> gets simpler if we differentiate it by <span class="process-math">\(\sin x\)</span> doesn’t, this suggests that we should set <span class="process-math">\(u = x\text{.}\)</span> And since <span class="process-math">\(u = x\text{,}\)</span> we must have <span class="process-math">\(dv = \sin x\,dx\)</span> (since <span class="process-math">\(dv\)</span> automatically becomes whatever is left over).
