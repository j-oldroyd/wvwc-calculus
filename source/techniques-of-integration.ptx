    <title>Techniques of Integration</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            This chapter focuses on several techniques for evaluating complicated integrals.
            As the tools in this chapter are in general more complicated than those that appeared in <xref ref="integrals" text="type-global" />, you should only use these if algebraic simplification or substitution are insufficient to compute an integral.

        <title>Integration by Parts</title>
        <p>
            Suppose we want to integrate <m>f(x) = x\sin x</m>.
            This can't be simplified using algebra (since integrals don't split up over products!) and substitution probably won't be very helpful, since <m>f(x)</m> does not already contain an "inside function" that we could replace.
            The integration tools that we have are unable to compute this integral, so we need to develop more tools!
        </p>
        <p>
            Recall that the substitution method for solving integrals from <xref ref="section-substitution" text="type-global" /> is derived from the chain rule.
            In fact, by <xref ref="theorem-fundamental-theorem-of-calculus" text="type-global" /> every derivative rule available to us also provides a corresponding integration rule.
            So perhaps the integration rule corresponding to the product rule can help us to integrate products.
            We call this method <em>integration by parts</em>.

            <statement>
                <p>
                    Let <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> be continuous functions, with <m>g(x)</m> differentiable.
                    Then
                </p>
                <me>\int f(x)g^{\prime}(x)\,dx = f(x)g(x) - \int g(x)f^{\prime}(x)\,dx.</me>
            </statement>
            <proof>
                <p>
                    By the product rule, we have <m>\dv{}{x}[f(x)g(x)] = f(x)g^{\prime}(x) + f^{\prime}(x)g(x)</m>.
                    Rearranging this, we have
                    <me>f(x)g^{\prime}(x) = [f(x)g(x)]^{\prime} - f^{\prime}(x)g(x).</me>
                    Finally, we can integrate both sides to get
                    <me>\int f(x)g^{\prime}(x)\,dx = f(x)g(x) - \int g(x)f^{\prime}(x)\,dx.</me>

            </proof>
        </theorem>
        <p>
            A useful way to remember the integration by parts method is as follows:
            <men xml:id="equation-integration-by-parts">\int u\,dv = uv - \int v\,du.</men>
            Integration by parts can be used to integrate products of functions <em>that can't already be evaluated by simpler means</em>.

            <title>Using the Integration by Parts Formula</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Compute <m>\int x\sin x\,dx</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    To use <xref ref="equation-integration-by-parts" text="type-global" />, we need to write <m>\int x\sin x\,dx</m> in the form <m>\int u\,dv</m>.
                    Once we have <m>u</m> and <m>dv</m>, then we can set up the rest of the formula.
                    One thing that can make this method tricky is the fact that we can have many different choices for <m>u</m> and <m>dv</m>; the only thing we need for certain is for <m>u\,dv = x\sin x</m> here.
                    However, if we look at the formula <xref ref="equation-integration-by-parts" text="type-global" /> then we'll see two new terms on the right hand side: <m>du</m> and <m>v</m>, together in the second integral.
                    This means that we'll need to differentiate <m>u</m> and integrate <m>v</m>, and this will suggest what both should be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since we need to compute <m>du</m>, then we want <m>u</m> to be easy to differentiate.
                    Similarly, we want <m>dv</m> to be easy to integrate.
                    And since we'd like to be able to compute this integral, we'd also like <m>v\,du</m> to be simpler than <m>u\,dv</m>.
                    Now return to <m>x\sin x</m>.
                    Since <m>x</m> gets simpler if we differentiate it by <m>\sin x</m> doesn't, this suggests that we should set <m>u = x</m>.
                    And since <m>u = x</m>, we must have <m>dv = \sin x\,dx</m> (since <m>dv</m> automatically becomes whatever is left over).
                    With these choices, we have

            <p>
                You may be wondering why we didn't include an arbitrary constant when we found <m>v</m> in <xref ref="example-using-the-integration-by-parts-formula" text="type-global" />.
                This is because including an arbitrary constant here doesn't affect the final answer.
                It's certainly not incorrect to include one here, but it adds more work than is already necessary.

        <p>
            When using the integration by parts method, it's usually a good idea to choose <m>u</m> to be the polynomial portion of your integrand if there is one.
            This is because polynomials become simpler when they're differentiated.
            However, there are examples where <m>u</m> should be something else.

            <solution>
                <p>
                    Since we need to integrate a product, and we can't easily do so with <m>u</m>-substitution or algebra, we'll try integration by parts.
                    We could pick <m>u = 3x^{2}</m>, and this is certainly easy to differentiate so we can find <m>du</m>.
                    However, doing so leaves us with <m>dv = \ln x</m>, which is tricky to integrate, but is easy to differentiate.
                    So we'll try setting <m>u = \ln x</m> and <m>dv = 3x^{2}\,dx</m>.

                <p>
                    An important concept in the field of differential equations is that of the <em>Laplace transform</em>.
                    In the process of computing the Laplace transform of <m>\cos t</m>, an integral similar to <m>\int e^{t}\cos t\,dt</m> appears.
                    Determine this integral.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    Here, it doesn't make much difference what we select for <m>u</m> or <m>dv</m>, since both <m>e^{t}</m> and <m>\cos t</m> are easy to differentiate and integrate, while neither becomes simpler.
                    But since we're integrating a product, we'll try to use integration by parts anyway and hope for the best.
                    To that end, let <m>u = e^{t}</m> and <m>dv = \cos t</m>.
                    Then <m>du = e^{t}\,dt</m> and <m>v = \sin t</m>, which gives

                <p>
                    As expected, the new integral isn't any simpler than the one that we started with.
                    However, it's not any more <em>complicated</em> either.
                    So we'll try integration by parts on the new integral as well, with <m>u = e^{t}, du = e^{t}\,dt, dv = \sin t\,dt</m> and <m>v = -\cos t</m>.

                    So we have

                <p>
                    There is something very strange about this equation: <em>the same integral appears on both sides</em>.
                    This is no longer a calculus problem, it's an algebra problem!
                    Solving for the integral algebraically (and including the arbitrary constant!) gives
                    <me>\int e^{t}\cos t\,dt = \frac{e^{t}\sin t + e^{t}\cos t}{2} + C.</me>

                        Although it's not obvious, we can actually solve this integral with substitution.
                        First, we'll separate a power of <m>\cos3x</m> from the rest in order to act as our <m>du</m>:
                        <me>\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{6}}\cos^{4}(3x)\cos3x\,dx.</me>
                        Now, if we want <m>\cos3x</m> to act as <m>du</m> in a substitution, then we need <m>u</m> to look like <m>\sin3x</m>.
                        We can do this by using the Pythagorean Identity and writing <m>\cos^{4}(3x) = (1 - \sin^{2}(3x))^{2}</m>.

                    <p>
                        Now we'll set <m>u = \sin3x</m>, which gives <m>du = 3\cos3x\,dx</m> and

            <p>
                The trick we used above only worked because we had an odd power of cosine.
                In general, when integrating <m>\int\sin^{m}x\cos^{n}x\,dx</m>, you want to separate a factor from an odd power (if there is one).
                Then finish by using substitution.

            <title>Integrals Involving Powers of Secant and Tangent</title>
            <p>
                In contrast to those involving sine and cosine, all of the integrals here involving secant and tangent are solvable using substitution.
                Generally, we'll attack these problems by separating a factor of <m>\sec^{2}x</m> (in which case we use <m>u = \tan x</m>) or a factor of <m>\sec x\tan x</m> (in which case we use <m>u = \sec x</m>).
                This will often be done using the <em>Pythagorean identity</em>
                <me>\tan^{2}x = \sec^{2}x - 1 </me>
                We will occasionally need to make use of two integral formulas:
                <md>
                    <mrow>\int\sec x\,dx &amp; = \ln|\sec x + \tan x| + C </mrow>

                </md>
            </p>

                        Determine <m>\int_{-\frac{\pi}{4}}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{6}w\,dw</m>.

                    <p>
                        Our goal is to separate a factor of either <m>\sec^{2}w</m> or <m>\sec w\tan w</m> to serve as our <m>du</m>.
                        Since neither appears, we'll use the Pythagorean identity to introduce a <m>\sec^{2}w</m> into our integral:
                        <me>\int_{-\frac{\pi}{4}}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{6}w\,dw = \int_{-\frac{\pi}{4}}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{4}w\sec^{2}w\,dw - \int_{-\frac{\pi}{4}}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{4}w\,dw.</me>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At this point the first integral can be solved using substitution, but the second integral needs to be rewritten again.
                        However, the same trick we applied before works here too: just use the Pythagorean identity to introduce a factor of <m>\sec^{2}w</m>.
                        This gives
                        <md>
                            <mrow>\int_{-\frac{\pi}{4}}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{6}w\,dw &amp; = \int_{-\frac{\pi}{4}}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{4}w\sec^{2}w\,dw - \int_{-\frac{\pi}{4}}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2}w\sec^{2}w\,dw + \int_{-\frac{\pi}{4}}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2}w\,dw.</mrow>

                <ul>
                    <li>If the power of secant is <em>even</em>, then separate a factor of <m>\sec^{2}x</m> and use <m>u = \tan x</m>, along with the Pythagorean identity if necessary.</li>
                    <li>If the power of tangent is <em>odd</em>, then separate a factor of <m>\sec x\tan x</m> and use <m>u = \sec x</m>, along with the Pythagorean identity if necessary.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                        We're dealing with an odd power of secant, so splitting off a factor of <m>\sec^{2}x</m> won't help here.
                        We also lack a <m>\tan x</m> term, so splitting off a factor of <m>\sec x\tan x</m> is tricky as well.
                        We'll try integrating by parts instead, with

            <p>
                An ellipse with horizontal axis length <m>a</m> and vertical axis length <m>b</m> centered at the origin is given by
                <me>\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} + \frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1.</me>
                If we want to find the area of this ellipse, then we can compute the following integral and multiply it by <m>4</m>:
                <me>\int_{0}^{a}\sqrt{b^{2} - (\frac{b}{a})^{2}x^{2}}\,dx = \int_{0}^{a}\frac{b}{a}\sqrt{a^{2} - x^{2}}\,dx.</me>
                This integral is difficult to solve due to the square root in the integrand; it's tough to imagine what an antiderivative might be.
                So what we'll try to do is to use a "reverse substitution" that simplifies the square root.
            </p>
            <p>
                To do so, notice that the Pythagorean identity gives <m>\cos^{2}\theta = 1 - \sin^{2}\theta</m>.
                Taking the square root of the left hand side is much easier here than taking a root of the right hand side.
                So we'll try that substitution here: let
                <md>
                    <mrow>x &amp; = a\sin\theta </mrow>
                    <mrow>dx &amp; = a\cos\theta\,d\theta </mrow>
                </md>
                Then
                <md>
                    <mrow>\int_{0}^{a}\sqrt{a^{2} - x^{2}}\,dx &amp; = \int_{x = 0}^{x = a}\sqrt{a^{2} - a^{2}\sin^{2}\theta}a\cos\theta\,d\theta </mrow>
                    <mrow> &amp; = a^{2}\int_{x = 0}^{x = a}\cos^{2}\theta\,d\theta </mrow>
                </md>
                Before we go further, let's figure out what our new limits are.
                Since <m>x = a\sin\theta</m>, we have <m>\theta = \sin^{-1}\frac{x}{a}</m>, and so <m>-\frac{\pi}{2} \lt \theta \lt \frac{\pi}{2}</m>.
                Hence we need our limits for <m>\theta</m> to be <m>\theta = 0</m> and <m>\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}</m>, and so we get
                <me>\int_{0}^{a}\sqrt{a^{2} - x^{2}}\,dx = a^{2}\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\cos^{2}\theta\,d\theta.</me>
                We've seen how to integrate a function like this in <xref ref="example-integrating-even-powers-of-cosine" text="type-global" />.
                Hence the area of this ellipse is
                <me>4\int_{0}^{a}\frac{b}{a}\sqrt{a^{2} - x^{2}}\,dx = 4ab\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\cos^{2}\theta\,d\theta = ab\pi.</me>
            </p>
            <p>
                This method is known as <term>trigonometric substitution</term>, and is useful for simplifying radicals.

                        Even though this integral involves only exponentials, we can simplify it using trigonometric substitution due to the presence of the radical.
                        First, we'll use <m>u</m>-substitution to rewrite the integral into a form more suitable for trigonometric substitution: with <m>u = e^{t}</m> and <m>du = e^{t}\,dt</m>, we get
                        <me>\int\frac{e^{t}}{(4 + e^{2t})^{3/2}}\,dt = \int\frac{du}{(4 + u^{2})^{3/2}}.</me>

                    <p>
                        The appearance of <m>4 + u^{2}</m> in the denominator suggests that we use a tangent substitution, namely, <m>u = 2\tan\theta</m>.
                        Then <m>du = 2\sec^{2}\theta\,d\theta</m>, and we get
                        <md>
                            <mrow>\int\frac{du}{(4 + u^{2})^{3/2}} &amp; = \int\frac{2\sec^{2}\theta}{4^{3/2}(1 + \tan^{2}\theta)^{3/2}}\,d\theta </mrow>

                        </md>
                        Using triangles, we can simplify this further to get
                        <me>\int\frac{e^{t}}{(4 + e^{2t})^{3/2}}\,dt = \frac{e^{t}}{4\sqrt{4 + e^{2t}}} + C.</me>

            At this point we have tools available to us that allow us to compute integrals of products (<xref ref="section-integration-by-parts" text="type-global" />), and trigonometric functions and certain radicals(<xref ref="section-trigonometric-integrals-and-substitution" text="type-global" />).
            Now we'll move on to a tool that will help us integrate rational functions (quotients of polynomials).
            The idea behind this method is to write a rational function, such as <m>\frac{1}{x^{2} - 1}</m>, in terms of simpler fractions.
            We'll demonstrate by example.
        </p>

                    Let
                    <me>f(x) = \frac{1}{x^{2} - 1}.</me>
                    Find <m>\int f(x)\,dx</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    We could try secant substitution, but that we'll instead focus on simplifying this fraction.
                    First, factor the denominator:
                    <me>\frac{1}{x^{2} - 1} = \frac{1}{(x-1)(x+1)}.</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, assume that we can find constants <m>A_{1}, A_{2}</m> such that
                    <me>\frac{1}{x^{2} - 1} = \frac{A_{1}}{x-1} + \frac{A_{2}}{x + 1}.</me>
                    If we could find such constants, we could integrate the right hand side instead of the left hand side.
                    There are a few ways to find these constants, but the easiest might be to just clear fractions by multiplying both sides by <m>x^{2} - 1</m>:
                    <men xml:id="equation-partial-fraction-1">1 = A_{1}(x + 1) + A_{2}(x - 1).</men>
                </p>
                <p>
                    So <m>A_{1},A_{2}</m> need to satisfy this equation <em>for all possible values of</em> <m>x</m>.
                    We'll pick values for <m>x</m> that make it easy to find <m>A_{1}</m> and <m>A_{2}</m>.
                    If <m>x = -1</m>, then <xref ref="equation-partial-fraction-1" text="type-global" /> becomes
                    <me>1 = -2A_{2} \Rightarrow A_{2} = -\frac{1}{2}.</me>
                    Similarly, <m>A_{1} = \frac{1}{2}.</m>
                    Therefore

            Finding partial fraction decompositions as in <xref ref="example-integrating-a-rational-function" text="type-global" /> isn't too bad as long as the denominator can be factored into distinct (i.e. non-repeated) <em>linear factors</em>.
            The situation is more complicated if the factors are repeated or are quadratics (or both).

                <p>
                    Find the partial fraction decomposition for <m>\frac{1}{(x^{2} - 1)^{2}}</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    Since <m>\frac{1}{(x^{2} - 1)^{2}} = \frac{1}{(x-1)^{2}(x+1)^{2}}</m>, it's tempting to write
                    <me>\frac{1}{(x^{2}-1)^{2}} = \frac{A_{1}}{x-1} + \frac{A_{2}}{x+1}.</me>
                    Unfortunately, doing so gives <m>A_{1} = A_{2} = 0</m>, which obviously won't work.
                    If we instead use
                    <me>\frac{1}{(x^{2}-1)^{2}} = \frac{A_{1}}{(x-1)^{2}} + \frac{A_{2}}{(x+1)^{2}},</me>
                    we get <m>A_{1} = A_{2} = \frac{1}{4}</m>.
                    However,
                    <me>\frac{1}{(x^{2}-1)^{2}} \neq \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{(x-1)^{2}} + \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{(x+1)^{2}}.</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we need to do is assume
                    <me>\frac{1}{(x^{2}-1)^{2}} = \frac{A_{1}}{x-1} + \frac{A_{2}}{x+1} + \frac{A_{3}}{(x-1)^{2}} + \frac{A_{4}}{(x+1)^{2}}.</me>
                    If we don't account for <em>each</em> power, we're not guaranteed a partial fraction decomposition.
                    Now let's clear fractions:
                    <men xml:id="equation-partial-fraction-2"> 1 = A_{1}(x-1)(x+1)^{2} + A_{2}(x+1)(x-1)^{2} + A_{3}(x+1)^{2} + A_{4}(x-1)^{2}.</men>
                    Quickly, using <m>x=-1</m> we find that <m>A_{4} = \frac{1}{4}</m>, and using <m>x = 1</m> we find that <m>A_{3} = \frac{1}{4}</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point there are no nice values left to plug into the right hand side of <xref ref="equation-partial-fraction-2" text="type-global" />, so we need to find <m>A_{1}</m> and <m>A_{2}</m> another way.
                    One possibility is to differentiate both sides to make the right hand side simpler, which gives
                    <men xml:id="equation-partial-fraction-3">0 = A_{1}(x+1)^{2} + 2A_{1}(x^{2}-1) + A_{2}(x-1)^{2} + 2A_{2}(x^{2} - 1) + 2A_{3}(x+1) + 2A_{4}(x-1).</men>
                    Now, entering <m>x = -1</m> into <xref ref="equation-partial-fraction-3" text="type-global" /> gives
                    <me>0 = 4A_{2} - 4A_{4}</me>
                    and so <m>A_{2} = A_{4} = \frac{1}{4}</m>.
                    Similarly, <m>A_{1} = - A_{3} = -\frac{1}{4}</m>.
                    Therefore
                    <me>\frac{1}{(x^{2} - 1)}^{2} = \frac{1}{4}\left[-\frac{1}{x-1} + \frac{1}{x+1} + \frac{1}{(x-1)^{2}} + \frac{1}{(x+1)^{2}}\right].</me>

        </example>
        <p>
            In order to find partial fraction decompositions when the denominator contains a quadratic, we must allow for the possibility of the numerator being <em>linear</em>.

                    First, we can simplify:
                    <me>\frac{x^{3} + 5x^{2}}{x^{5} + 3x^{3}} = \frac{x + 5}{x(x^{2} + 3)}.</me>
                    Now that we've factored the denominator, we can attempt to find the partial fraction decomposition.
                    So assume that
                    <me>\frac{x + 5}{x(x^{2} + 3)} = \frac{A_{1}}{x} + \frac{A_{2}x + A_{3}}{x^{2} + 3}</me>
                    Note the linear term <m>A_{2}x + A_{3}</m> above the quadratic!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rest of this computation goes like it did before.
                    If we clear fractions, we get
                    <me>x + 5 = A_{1}(x^{2} + 3) + A_{2}x^{2} + A_{3}x.</me>
                    If we plug in <m>x = 0</m>, we obtain <m>A_{1} = \frac{5}{3}</m>.
                    At this point, we could plug in <m>x = \sqrt{3}i</m> (which would be okay!) or differentiate both sides, but it might be easier to take the following approach: expand the right hand side and collect like terms to get
                    <me>x + 5 = (A_{1} + A_{2})x^{2} + A_{3}x + 3A_{1}.</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the right hand side to equal the left hand side, <m>A_{1} + A_{2}</m> <em>must be zero</em>.
                    Hence <m>A_{2} = -A_{1} = -\frac{5}{3}</m>.
                    Similarly, <m>A_{3}</m> <em>must equal one</em>.

                    Before setting up partial fractions, we should simplify the integrand as much as possible.
                    Here, we can use long division since the degree of the numerator is greater than or equal to the degree of the denominator.
                    Doing so, we get
                    <me>\frac{2y^{4}}{y^{3} - y^{2} + y - 1} = 2y + 2 + \frac{2}{y^{3} - y^{2} + y - 1}.</me>
                    We can integrate the first two terms on the right hand side easily, but we'll use partial fractions to rewrite the fraction:
                    <md>

                </p>

                    Now clear fractions to get
                    <me>2 = A_{1}y(y-1) + A_{2}(y-1) + A_{3}y^{2}.</me>
                    Setting <m>y = 0</m> gives <m>A_{2} = -2</m>, and setting <m>y = 1</m> gives <m>A_{3} = 2</m>.
                    To find <m>A_{1}</m>, we can expand the right hand side to write
                    <me>2 = A_{1}y^{2} - A_{1}y + A_{2}y - A_{2} + A_{3}y^{2}.</me>

                    Once again we have a radical causing problems, and it's not in any of the three trigonometric substitution forms we can use either.
                    We want it to go away, so we'll try just that: set <m>u = \sqrt{x}</m>, which gives <m>du = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}\,dx</m>.
                    Then
                    <me>\int_{\frac{1}{3}}^{3}\frac{\sqrt{x}}{x^{2} + x}\,dx = \int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}}^{\sqrt{3}}\frac{2x}{x^{2} + x}\,du.</me>
                    Now, we use the fact that <m>x = u^{2}</m> to write
                    <me>\int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}}^{\sqrt{3}}\frac{2x}{x^{2} + x}\,du = \int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}}^{\sqrt{3}}\frac{2u^{2}}{u^{4} + u^{2}}\,du</me>
                    which simplifies to
                    <me>\int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}}^{\sqrt{3}}\frac{2}{u^{2} + 1}\,du = 2\tan^{-1}(\sqrt{3}) - 2\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = \frac{\pi}{3}.</me>

            The computation of partial fraction decompositions can be greatly simplified with Sage.
            This can be done by using the <c>partial_fraction()</c> method.
            For example, the partial fraction decomposition of
            <me>f(x) = \frac{x - 3}{x^{2} - 1}</me>
            is determined by Sage to be
            <me>\frac{2}{x + 1} - \frac{1}{x - 1}</me>
            as follows:
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                # First we need to define f(x).
                f(x) = (x - 3)/(x^2 - 1)

                # Now we can compute the partial fraction decomposition.
                f(x).partial_fraction()

            </output>
        </sage>
        <p>
            Sage can also handle fractions that require long division as in the next example.

        <title>Improper Integrals</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>
                (Note: this section corresponds to Section 6.6 of the text.)
                Consider the following problem: determine the smallest velocity required for an object to escape the earth's gravitational pull (i.e., the <term>escape velocity</term>).
                We can try to answer this problem by looking at the total work <m>W</m> needed to move this object.
                From one viewpoint, work is just the total change in kinetic energy.
                If the object is moving at escape velocity, say <m>v_{e}</m>, then all of its kinetic energy must have been converted into work: <m>W = \frac{1}{2}m_{O}v_{e}^{2}</m>, where <m>m_{O}</m> is the mass of the object.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we'll see later, work is also the integral of force, so let's examine the force on the object.
                If we neglect air resistance and assume that the only force acting on the object is gravity, then the force exerted on the object is given by
                <me>F(r) = \frac{m_{E}m_{O}}{r^{2}}G,</me>
                where <m>m_{E}</m> is the mass of the Earth, <m>m_{O}</m> is still the mass of the object, <m>r</m> is the distance from the center of mass of the Earth to the center of mass of the object, and <m>G</m> is the gravitational constant.
                Now assume that the Earth is a sphere of radius <m>R_{0}</m>, and that the object has enough velocity to move it a distance of <m>R_{1}</m> units from the surface of the Earth.
                Then the total work done in moving the object this distance is
                <me>\int_{R_{0}}^{R_{1}}F(r)\,dr = m_{E}m_{O}G\int_{R_{0}}^{R_{1}}\frac{1}{r^{2}}\,dr.</me>
                Now let's think about should happen if the object is at escape velocity.
                In this case, theoretically at least, there should be no limit to the distance the object can travel if given enough time.
                So what's the total work done?
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's try to compute <m>m_{E}m_{O}G\int_{R_{0}}^{R_{1}}\frac{1}{r^{2}}\,dr.</m>
                We get
                <md>
                    <mrow>m_{E}m_{O}G\int_{R_{0}}^{R_{1}}\frac{1}{r^{2}}\,dr &amp; = -\frac{m_{E}m_{O}G}{r}\big]_{R_{0}}^{R_{1}} </mrow>
                    <mrow> &amp; = \frac{m_{E}m_{O}G}{R_{0}} - \frac{m_{E}m_{O}G}{R_{1}}. </mrow>
                </md>
                Note that this is still an underestimate for the total work theoretically done, since <m>R_{1}</m> can increase without bound.
                So let's send <m>R_{1}</m> to <m>\infty</m> and see what we get:
                <me>\lim_{R_{1}\to\infty}\frac{m_{E}m_{O}G}{R_{0}} - \frac{m_{E}m_{O}G}{R_{1}} = \frac{m_{E}m_{O}G}{R_{0}}.</me>
            </p>
            <p>
                So, to summarize, the total work <m>W</m> should be
                <me>W = \lim_{R_{1}\to\infty}\left(m_{E}m_{O}G\int_{R_{0}}^{R_{1}}\frac{1}{r^{2}}\,dr\right) = \frac{1}{2}m_{O}v_{e}^{2}</me>
                or just
                <me>W = \frac{m_{E}m_{O}G}{R_{0}} = \frac{1}{2}m_{O}v_{e}^{2}.</me>
                <em>We can solve this equation for <m>v_{e}</m></em>, and so the escape velocity should be
                <me>v_{e} = \sqrt{\frac{2 m_{E}G}{R_{0}}}.</me>
                As a neat bonus, this shows that the escape velocity only depends on <m>G</m>, the mass of the Earth <m>m_{E}</m> and the "radius" of the Earth <m>R_{0}</m>.
                Plugging in values for these figures, we get <m>v_{e} \approx 11185</m> meters per second, or <m>11.185</m> kilometers per second.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is all very important obviously, but this is calculus, and what <em>we</em> really care about are the mathematical tools required to solve this problem.
                To do this, we basically had to figure out what the integral of <m>\frac{1}{r^{2}}</m> was over the interval <m>[R_{0},\infty)</m>.
                This is our first example of an <term>improper integral</term>.

                For integrals, we have two comparison tests that allow us to determine if an improper integral converges by comparing it with a simpler integral.

                        <xref ref="theorem-direct-comparison-test-integral" text="type-global" /> implies that the original integral must converge as well.
                        Note that we don't know <em>what</em> it converges to, only that it does.

                    <p>
                        We can do this by breaking the integral into two parts:
                        <m>\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-x^{2}}\,dx = \int_{0}^{1}e^{-x^{2}}\,dx + \int_{1}^{\infty}e^{-x^{2}}\,dx.</m>

                        On the other hand, if <m>1\leq x\lt \infty</m>, then <m>e^{-x^{2}} \leq e^{-x}</m>.
                        Therefore

                        Hence the original integral must also be convergent.
                        It's value is actually known (see <xref ref="theorem-the-gaussian-integral" text="type-global" />), and Sage can also be used to compute its value as below.

                        The integrand is awful again, but if <m>x</m> is very large then we can say that

                        Since this limit exists and is positive, then the original integral must also converge by the Limit Comparison Test.

        <p>
            Up to now we have primarily considered integrals whose integrands involve functions with <em>elementary antiderivatives</em>.
            This roughly means that the antiderivative of such a function can be expressed with the <q>usual</q> functions of calculus.
            However, many important functions do not have elementary antiderivatives.
            One such example is the <em>Gaussian function</em> <m>f(x) = e^{-x^2}</m>.
            This is one of the most important functions in mathematics and its applications, but its integral has no exact form in terms of elementary functions like sine, cosine, the logarithm, and so on.
            Therefore it is important to <em>approximate</em> such integrals with numerical methods (a process also known as <em>quadrature</em>).
