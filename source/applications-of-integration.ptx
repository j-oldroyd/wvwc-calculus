    <title>Areas Between Curves</title>
    <p>
      We already know that <m>\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx</m> geometrically represents the area under <m>f(x)</m> from <m>x = a</m> to <m>x = b</m>.
      Now we'd like to try to extend the integral to other geometrical concepts such as surface areas and volumes.
      An easy generalization we can make right now is that of <em>areas between curves</em>, as in <xref ref="figure-area-between-curves" text="type-global" />.

    <p>
      It may not be too much of a stretch to say that the area <m>S</m> should be given by <m>\int_{a}^{b}[f(x) - g(x)]\,dx</m>, and indeed it is, but we will prove this using Riemann sums for the reason that Riemann sums appear <em>a lot</em> in applications.
      Furthermore, Riemann sums provide us with the formula we need to evaluate integrals numerically using libraries such as NumPy.
      So let's start by partitioning the interval <m>[a,b]</m> into <m>n</m> <em>subintervals</em>
      <me>[x_{i-1},x_{i}]\quad\text{for}\quad 0\leq i\leq n,</me>
      where <m>x_{0} = a, x_{n} = b</m> and
      <me>x_{i} - x_{i-1} = \Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}.</me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we'll use the subintervals to break the region <m>S</m> up into rectangles to approximate the area.
      So choose a point <m>x_{i}^{*}</m> from each subinterval <m>[x_{i-1}, x_{i}]</m> and use it to determine the height of the corresponding rectangle: <m>f(x_{i}^{*}) - g(x_{i}^{*})</m>.
      Then the area is <m>f(x_{i}^{*}) - g(x_{i}^{*})\Delta x</m>, and adding up the areas of all of the rectangles lets us approximate the area of <m>S</m>:
      <men xml:id="equation-area-between-curves-approximation">\text{area of }S \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n}[f(x_{i}^{*}) - g(x_{i}^{*})]\Delta x</men>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now send <m>n\to\infty</m> (equivalently, send <m>\Delta x\to 0</m>) to make the approximation exact:
      <m>\text{area of }S = \lim_{\Delta x\to0}\sum_{i=1}^{n}f(x_{i}^{*}) - g(x_{i}^{*})\Delta x = \int_{a}^{b}[f(x) - g(x)]\,dx.</m>

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          If we graph <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>, we see that the area will be given by <m>\int_{a}^{b}[(x^{2} + 1) - 2x^{2}]\,dx</m>, where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are the values of <m>x</m> where <m>f(x) = g(x)</m>.
          Using a bit of algebra, we get <m>a = -1</m> and <m>b = 1</m>.
          Therefore the area between the parabolas is

          To find the area between these curves, we'll need to compute <em>two</em> integrals: one for <m>0\leq x\leq 1</m> and another for <m>1\leq x\leq 2</m>.
          In particular, the area will be given by
          <m>\int_{0}^{1}[x^{\frac{1}{4}} - (-x^{\frac{1}{4}})]\,dx + \int_{1}^{2}[\sqrt{2 - x} - (-\sqrt{2 - x})]\,dx</m>.
          Doing so, we get
          <m>\frac{44}{15}</m>
          for the area between the curves.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      Part of the reason why finding the area in <xref ref="example-area-with-changing-limits" text="type-global" /> was more complicated was because the curves did not represent functions of <m>x</m>.
      However, we can view each curve as representing a function of <m>y</m>, namely,
      <m>x(y) = y^{4} \quad\text{and}\quad x(y) = 2 - y^{2}.</m>
      Then the area can be found as
      <m>\int_{-1}^{1}[(2 - y^{2}) - y^{4}]\,dy = \frac{44}{15}.</m>
      So it can be much easier if we find the area by integrating with respect to <m>y</m> as opposed to <m>x</m>.

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the area contained by the curves <m>x = y^{2} - 4y</m> and <m>x = 2y - y^{2}</m>.

          Finding the area by using integrals with respect to <m>x</m> would require setting up and solving three different integrals!
          So, not terrific.
          However, we can integrate with respect to <m>y</m> fairly easily.
          By finding where the curves intersect, we see that <m>0\leq y\leq 3</m>.
          Hence the area should be
          <md>
            <mrow>\int_{0}^{3}[(2y - y^{2}) - (y^{2} - 4y)]\,dy \amp = \int_{0}^{3}[6y - 2y^{2}]\,dy </mrow>

            <mrow> \amp = 27 - 18 </mrow>

    <title>Volumes</title>

      Just as we can with areas, we can attempt to find volumes using integrals as well.
      At the moment we can't find volumes of general regions without first describing integrals in higher dimensions, which is the content of <xref ref="multiple-integrals" text="type-global" />.
      Until then, we'll need to restrict ourselves to so-called <term>solids of revolution</term>.

      As an example, consider <xref ref="figure-solid-revolution-1" text="type-global" />.
      To generate the solid of revolution on the right, we take the graph of <m>y = f(x)</m> and rotate it about the <m>x</m>-axis, creating a three-dimensional region.

      To find the volume of such a region, the idea is to find the <em>area</em> of a general cross-section of the region, which by design should be a function of <m>x</m> alone, say <m>A(x)</m>.
      Then, roughly, <m>A(x)\Delta x</m> should represent the volume of a small cross-section of the solid, and so the integral <m>\int_{a}^{b}A(x)\,dx</m> should give us the volume of the region.
      This entire argument can be made precise using Riemann sums as in the previous section, and so we get the following: the solid <m>S</m> from <m>x = a</m> to <m>x = b</m> whose cross-sections (with respect to the <m>x</m>-axis) have area <m>A(x)</m> has volume given by
      <men xml:id="equation-solid-revolution-volume">V = \int_{a}^{b}A(x)\,dx.</men>
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example-finding-the-volume-of-a-sphere">
      <title>Finding the Volume of a Sphere</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the volume of a sphere of radius <m>r</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          To begin, let's assume that the sphere is centered at the origin.
          Then each cross section perpendicular to the <m>x</m>-axis is just a circle with radius <m>\sqrt{r^{2} - x^{2}}</m>.
          Hence each cross-sectional area is given by <m>A(x) = \pi(r^{2} - x^{2})</m>, which means the volume of the sphere should be
          <md>
            <mrow>\int_{-r}^{r}\pi(r^{2} - x^{2})\,dx \amp= 2\int_{0}^{r}\pi(r^{2} - x^{2})\,dx</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= 2\left[\pi r^{2}x - \frac{\pi x^{3}}{3}\right]_{0}^{r}</mrow>

            <mrow> \amp= \frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}.</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      Again, the idea for finding the volumes of these regions is to determine the cross-sectional areas perpendicular to the <m>x</m>-axis (or whatever the axis of rotation happens to be) and then integrate.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the volume of the region obtained by rotating the graph of <m>y = \sqrt{x}</m> from <m>x = 1</m> to <m>x = 4</m> about the line <m>y = 2</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          As is almost always the case, a good way to start is by graphing the region to get a rough idea of what it looks like.
          Doing so, we see that each of the cross-sections are circles.
          But this is to be expected, since the region is a solid of revolution.
          Given <m>x</m> between <m>1</m> and <m>4</m>, the area of the corresponding cross-section is given by
          <me>A(x) = \pi(2 - \sqrt{x})^{2}.</me>
          Hence the volume of this region should be
          <md>
            <mrow>\int_{1}^{4}\pi(2 - \sqrt{x})^{2}\,dx \amp= \pi\int_{1}^{4}(2 - 4\sqrt{x} + x)\,dx</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \pi\left[2x - \frac{8}{3}x^{\frac{3}{2}} + \frac{x^{2}}{2}\right]_{1}^{4}</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \pi\left[\left(8 - \frac{64}{3} + 8\right) - \left(2 - \frac{8}{3} + \frac{1}{2}\right)\right]</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      The previous problems involved finding volumes by using disks since disks were natural cross-sections.
      The next example instead uses washers as cross-sections instead.
      Although the formula we get for the volume is slightly different, it's still essentially integrating the areas of the cross-sections.

          Since the axis of rotation is <m>x = 2</m>, we want to look at cross-sections perpendicular to this line, i.e., parallel to the <m>x</m>-axis.
          Each such cross-section will look like a washer, and hence its area will involve the inner radius and outer radius of the washer.
          Since the radii are measured in terms of horizontal distance, we'll need to find <m>x</m> in terms of <m>y</m>.
          Doing so, we see that the inner radius is given by <m>2 - y</m> while the outer radius is given by <m>2 - y^{2}</m>.
          Therefore the volume of the region is given by

    <title>Volumes by Cylindrical Shells</title>
    <p>
      The method we used to find volumes in <xref ref="section-volumes" text="type-global" /> applies to solids that have cross-sections depending on <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> alone.
      Once we had a formula for this area, we could then integrate it to get the volume.
      However, not all shapes have such simple cross-sections, and so this method doesn't apply in general.
      In this section, we'll look at using cylindrical shells instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, the following fact will prove useful: the volume of a cylindrical shell of height <m>h</m>, inner radius <m>r_{1}</m> and outer radius <m>r_{2}</m> is given by
      <men xml:id="equation-volume-cylindrical-shell"> V = 2\pi\frac{r_{1} + r_{2}}{2}h(r_{2} - r_{1}) = 2\pi rh\Delta r</men>
      where <m>r</m> is the "average radius" and <m>\Delta r</m> is the thickness of the shell.
      If we can break a solid up into these cylindrical "cross-sections," then integrating these areas should again give us the volume of the solid.
      For shells that are perpendicular to the <m>x</m>-axis, we can typically replace <m>r</m> with <m>x</m> and <m>h</m> with <m>f(x)</m>, leading to an integral of the form
      <me>\int_{a}^{b}2\pi xf(x)\,dx.</me>
      <aside>
        <p>
          Finding areas using disks and washers usually involves finding disks/washers that are perpendicular to the axis of rotation.
          When finding volumes using shells, we'll typically use shells that are <em>parallel</em> to the axis of rotation.
        </p>
      </aside>
    </p>
    <p>
      One final note: this method, as in <xref ref="section-volumes" text="type-global" />, applies only to solids with a certain degree of symmetry.
      If you continue on to Calculus 3, the techniques you'll learn in <xref ref="multiple-integrals" text="type-global" /> will replace this method as they do the disk and washer methods from <xref ref="section-volumes" text="type-global" />.
      In particular, this method is a special case of the transformation to <em>cylindrical coordinates</em> presented in <xref ref="section-cylindrical-coordinates" text="type-global" />.

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The axis of rotation is the <m>y</m>-axis, so each shell should be perpendicular to this axis as well.
          Drawing a typical shell, we see that the radius at <m>x</m> should be <m>x</m> while the height is <m>f(x) = x^{2}</m>.
          So the volume of this region should be

    <p>
      It should be noted that the volume in <xref ref="example-finding-volumes-using-cylindrical-shells" text="type-global" /> could also have been found using washers instead of shells.
      If you can, you should use disks or washers before using shells, since integrals derived from using shells are typically more complicated.

      <statement>

          Find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by <m>x = 0</m>, <m>y = 4x - x^{2}</m> and <m>y = 8x - 2x^{2}</m> about the line <m>x = -2</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          A good first step, as always, is to plot the region.
          Since <m>y = 4x - x^{2}</m> and <m>y = 8x - 2x^{2}</m> give downward opening parabolas, we can quickly sketch a rough graph by finding the <m>x</m>-coordinates of the vertices, which occur at <m>x = 2</m>.
          Finding the corresponding <m>y</m> values, and noticing that each parabola intersects the <m>x</m>-axis at <m>x = 0, 4</m>, gives a pretty good picture of the graph.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we tried to find the volume using disks/washers, we'd need to solve <m>y = 4x - x^{2}</m> and <m>y = 8x - 2x^{2}</m> for <m>x</m> since each cross-section would be parallel to the <m>x</m>-axis.
          This is doable using the quadratic formula, but the algebra would get very bad very quickly once we start integrating.
          So we'll try shells instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          A typical shell for this region has radius <m>x - (-2) = x + 2</m> and height <m>(8x - 2x^{2}) - (4x - x^{2}) = 4x - x^{2}</m>.
          Hence the volume is given by

      Our goal now is to determine how far the particle travels as <m>x</m> goes from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m>.
      In other words, we want to find the length of this curve from <m>x=a</m> to <m>x=b</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the curve were just a line we could easily find its length by using the Pythagorean theorem, but for a more general curve like this we're stuck.
      So we'll start by approximating the curve by using line segments, which we'll call <m>L_1</m>, <m>L_2</m>, and so on up to <m>L_{n}</m>, then we'll find the lengths of the line segments.
      Say the first line segment goes from <m>x=x_0</m> to <m>x=x_1</m>, the second from <m>x=x_1</m> to <m>x=x_2</m> and so on.
      To make life simpler, we'll assume that all these intervals have equal length <m>\Delta x</m>.
      That is, <me>x_{i} - x_{i-1}  = \Delta x</me> for <m>0 \leq i\leq n</m>.
      Also, we'll define <m>\Delta y_{i} = f(x_{i}) - f(x_{i-1})</m>.

      If we look at <m>L_1</m>, then the line goes <m>\Delta x</m> in the <m>x</m>-direction and <m>\Delta y_1</m> in the <m>y</m>-direction, so by the Pythagorean theorem,
      <me>\text{length of } L_1 = \sqrt{(\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y_1)^2} = \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{\Delta y_{i}}{\Delta x}\right)}\Delta x.</me>
      Now if <m>\Delta x \approx 0</m>, then <m>\frac{\Delta y_{1}}{\Delta x} \approx f^\prime(x_{1})</m>.

    <title>Area of a Surface of Revolution</title>
    <p>
      Consider a function <m>y=f(x)</m>.
      We generate a solid of revolution by rotating the graph of <m>f(x)</m> from <m>x=a</m> to <m>x=b</m> about the <m>x</m>-axis.
      We want to find the surface area of this figure. We can't find it directly yet, but we can approximate it by using conical frustums.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surface area of a conical frustum is given by the formula
      <me>S_{F}=\pi(R_{1}+R_{2})\sqrt{(\Delta x)^{2}+(\Delta y)^{2}}=\pi(R_{1}+R_{2})\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\right)^{2}}\Delta x.</me>
      If <m>\Delta x\approx0</m> then we can say
      <me>S_{F}\approx2\pi f(x)\sqrt{1+f'(x)^{2}}\Delta x</me>
      for some <m>f(x)</m> between <m>R_{1}</m> and <m>R_{2}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using multiple frustums, we can approximate the surface area of the solid. Break <m>[a,b]</m> into <m>n</m> subintervals
      <me>[x_{0},x_{1}],[x_{1},x_{2}],\ldots,[x_{n-1},x_{n}]</me>
      with <m>x_{0}=a</m> and <m>x_{n}=b</m>, where each subinterval has length <m>\Delta x</m>.
      Then if <m>S</m> is the surface area of the solid, we have
      <md>
        <mrow>S\amp\approx\text{sum of areas of frustums}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp\approx\sum_{k=1}^{n}2\pi f(x_{i})\sqrt{1+f'(x_{i})^{2}}\Delta x.</mrow>
      </md>
      This approximation should become more exact as <m>\Delta x \to 0</m>, so we have
      <me>S=\lim_{\Delta x\to0}\sum_{k=1}^{n}2\pi f(x_{i})\sqrt{1+f'(x_{i})^{2}}\Delta x</me>
      or
      <me>S=\int_{a}^{b}2\pi f(x)\sqrt{1+f'(x)^{2}}\,dx.</me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, if we generate a solid of revolution by rotating <m>x=g(y)</m> from <m>y=c</m> to <m>y=d</m> about the <m>y</m>-axis, the surface area of this solid is given by

          We can create a sphere of radius <m>r</m> by rotating the semicircle <m>y=\sqrt{r^{2}-x^{2}}</m> about the <m>x</m>-axis, from <m>x=-r</m> to <m>x=r</m>. So <m>f(x)=\sqrt{r^{2}-x^{2}}</m> and <m>f^\prime(x)=\displaystyle\frac{-x}{\sqrt{r^{2}-x^{2}}}</m>. So the surface area is

    <title>Applications to Physics and Engineering</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        The primary use of integrals in physics and engineering is to measure the accumulation of continuously varying quantities.
        The running theme in this section:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><p>Measure the accumulation of some quantity by approximating it as a (finite) sum of "small" values.</p></li>
        <li><p>Improve the approximation by taking more and more values.</p></li>

      <title>Work</title>
      <p>
        We introduced a formula for work in <xref ref="section-improper-integrals" text="type-global" />, and now we'll actually derive it.
        First, recall that <term>work</term> (very roughly) represents the net effect of a <term>force</term> <m>F</m> acting on a mass over some displacement <m>d</m>.
        If the force is constant (in both magnitude and direction), then we can simply define the work <m>W</m> accomplished by a force <m>F</m> as a particle is displaced by <m>d</m> units by the formula
        <me>W = Fd.</me>
      </p>
      <p>
        So with this definition, work is proportional to the magnitude of the force <m>F</m> as well as the displacement <m>d</m> over which the force acts.
        If <m>F</m> is measured in units of
        <quantity>
          <unit base="meter" />
          <per base="second" exp="2"/>
        </quantity>
        or more simply
        <quantity>
          <unit base="newton" />
        </quantity>,
        and <m>d</m> is measured in units of
        <quantity>
          <unit base="meter" />
        </quantity>
        the <m>W</m> takes on units of
        <quantity>
          <unit base="newton" />
          <unit base="meter" />
        </quantity>
        or just
        <quantity>
          <unit base="joule" />
        </quantity>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although there are important forces that are reasonably approximated by constants, such as the force due to gravity, this isn't reasonable for every force of interest.
        For example, consider the force due to drag against an object moving through the atmosphere, which should increase as velocity increases.
        Another basic example is the <term>Hooke's Law</term>, which states that the force a spring exerts on an attached mass is proportional to the displacement of the mass from the spring's equilibrium position.
        For these non-constant forces, our old formula doesn't work so well.
        To be precise, how can we measure the work done by a non-constant force <m>F(x)</m> on a particle as it moves from <m>x = a</m> to <m>x = b</m>?
      </p>
      <p>
        As you might guess from this section's running theme, we'll start by <em>approximating</em> the work done by measuring work in small displacements as the particle moves from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m>.
        Over small enough intervals, even variable forces will look almost constant, which makes <m>W = Fd</m> a reasonable estimate of the work done (on this small interval!).
        So let's start by breaking up <m>[a,b]</m> into <m>n</m> smaller subintervals
        <me>[x_{0}, x_{1}], [x_{1}, x_{2}], \ldots, [x_{n-1}, x_{n}],</me>
        where <m>a = x_{0} \lt x_{1} \lt \ldots \lt x_{n} = b</m>, and let <m>\Delta x_{i} = x_{i} - x_{i-1}</m> be the width of each subinterval.
        Now choose sample points <m>x_{i}^{*}</m> from each subinterval.
        Once again, if <m>\Delta x_{i}</m> is small enough, then the work done by the force over <m>[x_{i-1}, x_{i}]</m> should be approximately
        <me> F(x_{i}^{*})\Delta x_{i}.</me>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the approximate work for one subinterval, so adding in the approximations from the other subintervals also provides an estimate of the total work <m>W</m> done by <m>F(x)</m> over <m>[a,b]</m>.
        That is,
        <me>W \approx F(x_{1}^{*})\Delta x_{1} + \cdots + F(x_{n}^{*})\Delta x_{n} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}F(x_{i}^{*})\Delta x_{i}.</me>
        As <m>\Delta x_{i}\to 0</m>, the approximation becomes exact.
        Therefore
        <men xml:id="equation-work-integral"> W = \lim_{\Delta x_{i}\to 0}\sum_{i=1}^{n}F(x_{i}^{*})\Delta x_{i} = \int_{a}^{b}F(x)\,dx.</men>
      </p>
      <example xml:id="example-a-mass-attached-to-a-spring">
        <title>A mass attached to a spring</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            A mass attached to a spring is acted upon by a <term>spring force</term> given by <m>F(t) = -2x</m>, where <m>x</m> is the displacement of the mass from the equilibrium position of the spring.
            Suppose that the mass is held
            <quantity>
              <mag>1</mag>
              <unit base="meter" />
            </quantity>
            to the right of the spring's equilibrium position (so that the spring will try to pull the mass back towards its equilibrium which we'll say occurs at <m>x = 0</m>).
            What is the work done by the spring on the mass in moving the mass from its current position back to equilibrium?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Since equilibrium occurs at <m>x = 0</m>, the work done should be
            <me>W = \int_{1}^{0}(-2x)\,dx = \int_{0}^{1}2x\,dx = 1.</me>
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="example-a-mass-attached-to-a-spring" text="type-global" />, the reason the work done was positive was because the force and the direction the mass was moving tended to align.
        Once the mass moves past equilibrium and to the left, the force will begin acting against the motion of the mass resulting in negative work over that particular interval.
        The spring force itself is an example of a <term>restoring force</term>, since it's always trying to pull the mass back to equilibrium.
        To highlight this, we often write the spring force as <m>F_{S} = -kx</m> for some positive <m>k</m>.

      <p>
        Consider a system of two point masses <m>m_{1},m_{2}</m> connected by a rod of negligible mass (so we can assume that the mass of the system is just <m>m_{1}+m_{2}</m>).
        These masses are located at the points <m>x_{1},x_{2}</m> on the <m>x</m>-axis.
        The rod is then placed upon a fulcrum at the point <m>x=c</m>, as shown below:

      </figure>
      <p>
        Our goal is to find the center of mass of the rod.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose that the first mass is <m>d_{1}</m> units away from the fulcrum, and that the second mass is <m>d_{2}</m> units away.
        Archimedes' Law of the Lever states that the rod will balance if <m>m_{1}d_{1} = m_{2}d_{2}</m>.
        Since <m>d_{1} = c - x_{1}</m> and <m>d_{2} = x_{2} - c</m> (since <m>d_{1},d_{2}</m> are positive!), we can rewrite this as
        <md>
          <mrow>m_{1}d_{1} \amp= m_{2}d_{2}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp\Rightarrow</mrow>
          <mrow>m_{1}(c-x_{1}) \amp= m_{2}(x_{2}-c)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp\Rightarrow</mrow>
          <mrow>m_{1}c-m_{1}x_{1} \amp= m_{2}x_{2} - m_{2}c</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp\Rightarrow</mrow>
          <mrow>m_{1}c+m_{2}c \amp= m_{1}x_{1}+m_{2}x_{2}</mrow>
        </md>
        which simplifies down to
        <me>c = \frac{m_{1}x_{1}+m_{2}x_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}.</me>
        Hence <m>c</m> is the location of the center of mass of the rod if this equation is true!
      </p>
      <p>
        More generally, if <m>n</m> point masses <m>m_{i}</m> at position <m>x=x_{i}</m> are connected by a rod of negligible mass, then the center of mass <m>\overline{x}</m> of the resulting system is given by

        <me>
          \overline{x} = \frac{m_{1}x_{1}+m_{2}x_{2}+\cdots+m_{n}x_{n}}{m_{1}+m_{2}+\cdots+m_{n}} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}m_{i}x_{i}}{m},

        where <m>m = \sum_{j=1}^{n}m_{j}</m> is the total mass of the system and

          Consider a system of point masses <m>m_{1},\ldots,m_{n}</m> at the points <m>(x_{1},y_{1}),\ldots,(x_{n},y_{n})</m>, and suppose that these masses are connected by a thin plate of negligible mass.

        <p>
          This can be thought of as tendency of the system to rotate <em>about</em> the <m>y</m>-axis.
          Increasing the mass or the distance from the <m>y</m>-axis increases this tendency.

          Just as in the one-dimensional case, the center of mass for this system will be determined by the total mass and the above moments.
          In particular, the center of mass of this system is located at the point <m>(\overline{x},\overline{y})</m> with coordinates

        We now consider a more complicated situation than the above.
        Suppose that we have a thin, flat plate (or <em>lamina</em>) <m>R</m> of uniform density in the plane.
        Our goal now is to find the center of mass, or <term>centroid</term>, of the plate.
        To do so, we will use the following fact: <em>the centroid of a rectangular lamina of uniform density is just the center of the rectangle.</em>
        Now consider a lamina <m>R</m> with uniform density <m>\rho</m> in the <m>xy</m>-plane and bounded between <m>x=a,x=b</m> and the functions <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m>:

        It is straightforward to check if a function is a solution of some given differential equation, but <em>finding</em> solutions involves a bit more work.

        <solution>
          <p>
            At this point we don't know how to solve differential equations, but that doesn't mean we can't <em>check</em> solutions of differential equations.
            To do so, we just plug <m>5e^{x^{2}}</m> wherever <m>y</m> shows up in the ODE and see if the resulting equation is true.
            So we have

            This is a true statement, so <m>y = 5e^{x^{2}}</m> satisfies the ODE.

        You can check that <m>y = 3e^{x^{2}}</m> and <m>y = -10e^{x^{2}}</m> are also solutions.

        Many ODEs are difficult, if not impossible, to solve exactly.
        The simplest ODEs to solve are the first-order ODEs of the form <m>\dv{y}{x} = f(x)</m>.
        The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus guarantees that the solution <m>y</m> is given by <m>y = \int f(x)\,dx</m>.

        Another type of ODE that is relatively straightforward to solve is the <term>separable ODE</term>, which is a first-order ODE that can be written in the form
        <me>\dv{y}{x} = f(x)g(y)</me>.
        These ODEs can be solved by integration as well, but only after some rearranging.

            Solve the IVP given by <m>y^\prime = x+4xy^{2}, y(0)=1</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p>
            The first step to solving this IVP is to solve the ODE <m>y^\prime = x+4xy^{2}</m>.
            It may not look like it at first, but this ODE is separable since we can rewrite it as <m>y^\prime = x(1+4y^{2})</m>.
            To solve this ODE, we need to move the <m>y</m> terms to the left hand side of the equation and the <m>x</m> terms to the right hand side.
            We'll abuse notation a little bit to do so by rewriting <m>y^\prime = \dv{y}{x}</m> and treating <m>\dv{y}{x}</m> as a fraction, but it won't get us into too much trouble here:
            <md>
              <mrow>\dv{y}{x} = x(1+4y^{2}) \amp\Rightarrow \frac{dy}{1+4y^{2}} = x\,dx </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp \Rightarrow \int\frac{dy}{1+4y^{2}}  = \int x\,dx </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp \Rightarrow \frac{1}{2}\tan^{-1}(2y)  = \frac{1}{2}x^{2}+C </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp \Rightarrow \tan^{-1}(2y)  = x^{2}+C_{1} </mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>

          <p>
            At this step we can either leave the solution as is (in <term>implicit form</term>) or solve for <m>y</m> to get an <term>explicit form</term>.
            We'll leave this in implicit form and then plug in the initial condition to get
            <me>\tan^{-1}(2) = C_{1}.</me>
            So the implicit solution of this IVP is given by
            <me>\tan^{-1}(2y) = x^{2}+\tan^{-1}(2).</me>
            <aside>
              <p>
                We can also find an <em>explicit</em> form of the solution by solving for <m>y</m>:

            At this point we have an implicit solution of our ODE, and we just need to solve for <m>x</m> to get the explicit solution.

        It is occasionally difficult to determine if an ODE of the form
        <me>\dv{y}{x} = f(x, y)</me>

        Thankfully, there is an algebraic method available that determines whether or not an ODE is separable and, if so, provides a factorization.
        This method works by first finding some point <m>(x_0, y_0)</m> such that <m>f(x_0,y_0) \neq 0</m>.
        Then we define
        <men xml:id="equation-differential-equations-separability-condition">

        </men>.
        If <m>f(x,y) = F(x)G(y)</m> then the ODE is separable and <m>F(x)G(y)</m> provides a factorization of <m>f(x,y)</m>.
        If <m>f(x,y)\neq F(x)G(y)</m> then the equation is not separable.

              The solution of this differential equation can now be found using the methods of this section.
              In particular, using Sage and the <c>desolve</c> command we get the following:
            </p>

            <sage>
              <input>
                # Define y as a function of x

              With a little bit of work, we can also convince Sage to turn this implicit solution into an explicit solution by solving for <m>y</m>.
              The heavy lifting here is done by the <c>.log_simplify()</c> and <c>.solve()</c> methods.
              In order to help Sage with simplifying the logarithms, we will clear fractions first.
              This prevents any radicals from appearing inside of the logarithms after simplification and makes solving for <m>y</m> easier:

                # Be sure to run the previous cell before this one!
                # Now clear fractions in front of the logs in f

                # Now we simplify and solve

        Suppose we're monitoring the population of some species, and let's denote the population at time <m>t</m> by <m>P(t)</m>.
        An obvious question to consider is how that population will change over time.
        Mathematically, this means we want to obtain information on <m>\dv{P}{t}</m> and then use it to estimate <m>P(t)</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A simple model for <m>\dv{P}{t}</m> is to assume it depends only on the birth rate <m>\beta</m> and death rate <m>\delta</m> of the species in question.
        Then we can write
        <men xml:id="equation-natural-growth">
            \dv{P}{t} = (\beta - \delta)P.
        </men>
        If we assume that <m>\beta,\delta</m> are constants, then this equation is separable and we can solve it to obtain

            P(t) = P_{0}e^{(\beta - \delta)t},

        We call <xref ref="equation-natural-growth" text="hybrid" /> the <term>natural growth equation</term>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The natural growth equation is simple, but it's probably too simple to be useful expect in certain scenarios (such as measuring half-life).
        To get a more flexible model, we can generalize <xref ref="equation-natural-growth" text="hybrid" /> by assuming that the birth and death rates are actually functions of time.
        This gives us the <em>general population equation</em>.

      <p>
        <xref ref="example-population-explosion" text="type-global" /> shows that we need to be more careful with our assumptions on population growth.
        One relatively simple assumption we can make is to assume that the birth rate <m>\beta(t)</m> decreases as population <m>P</m> increases.
        This makes sense in the physical world as well: as population increases, existing and finite resources (such as food) must be shared between more and more members of the population.
        Since there's less to go around, we should expect growth to slow down.
        In particular, let's assume that

          <mrow>\beta(t) \amp = \beta_{0} - \beta_{1}P </mrow>

          Since the constant <m>r = kM</m> affects the growth or decay of a logistic population, the logistic equation <xref ref="equation-applications-integration-logistic-ode" text="type-global" /> is sometimes written in the following form:
          <me>\dv{P}{t} = rP\parens{1 - \frac{P}{M}}</me>.

          <p>

        <title>Population growth in the USA</title>

        <statement>
          <p>
            In millions, the population of the USA in 2010 was <m>309.3</m> and was growing at a rate of <m>2.3</m> per year.
            In 2020, the population was <m>329.5</m> and was growing at a rate of <m>2.4</m> per year.
            Assuming that the population of the USA grows logistically, estimate the population of the USA in 2023 and compare it to the current estimate of <m>334.2</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p>
            Let <m>P(t)</m> denote the population of the USA (in millions), where <m>t</m> is the number of years after 2010.
            Then
            <me>\dv{P}{t} = kP(M-P)</me>
            and
            <me>P(t) = \frac{MP_{0}}{P_{0} + (M - P_{0})e^{-kMt}}.</me>
            So we need to find <m>k</m> and <m>M</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            When <m>t = 0</m>, we have <m>P^\prime = 2.3</m> and <m>P = 309.3</m>.
            Similarly, when <m>t = 10</m> we have <m>P^\prime = 1.2</m> and <m>P = 329.5</m>.
            Therefore
            <md>
              <mrow>2.3 \amp = 309.3k(M - 309.3) </mrow>
              <mrow>1.2 \amp = 329.5k(M - 329.5) </mrow>
            </md>.
            We need to solve this system to find <m>k</m> and <m>M</m> so we can finish setting up our model.
            This is easily accomplished with Sage's <c>solve</c> command:

            <input>
              # Tell Sage that k, M are variables
              var('k, M')

              # Set up equations to solve
              eq1 = 2.3 == 309.3*k*(M - 309.3)
              eq2 = 1.2 == 329.5*k*(M - 329.5)

              # Solve the system for k, M
              solve([eq1, eq2], k, M)
            </input>

            <output>
              [[k == (38669/205866987), M == (134911787/386690)]]
            </output>
          </sage>

          <p>
            Therefore
            <me>k\approx 0.00019\text{ and }M\approx348.8887</me>.
            We can now plug these values into <xref ref="equation-applications-integration-logistic-ode-solution" text="type-global" /> to get
            <me>P(t) \approx \frac{107911}{39.5887 \, e^{\left(-0.06553 \, t\right)} + 309.3}</me>.
            Our population estimate in the year <m>2023</m> is then
            <me>P(13) \approx 330.8</me>
            This has a relative error of about <m>1\%</m>.

      <p>
        The logistic equation
        <me>\dv{P}{t} = kP(M-P)</me>
        is a particularly nice separable ODE since the right hand side depends only on the unknown function <m>P</m>.
        So we can write <m>P^\prime = f(P)</m>, where <m>f(P) = kP(M-P)</m>.
        ODEs like this (where the independent variable does not appear explicitly) are called <term>autonomous ODEs</term>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Autonomous ODEs like <m>\dv{x}{t} = f(x)</m> are useful because the behavior of their solutions can be determined <em>qualitatively</em>, without actually solving the ODE.
        This is done by looking for the constant solutions of the ODE, that is, solutions of the form <m>x = c</m>.
        For any such solution, we must have <m>f(c) = 0</m> as well.
        These solutions (i.e., the solutions of <m>f(x) = 0</m>) are called the <term>critical points</term> or <term>equilibrium solutions</term> of the ODE.
        These solutions completely determine the long-term behavior of <em>every other solution</em>.

        We can also determine phase diagrams graphically.
        For instance, consider the phase diagram depicted in <xref ref="figure-phase-diagram" text="type-global" />.
        The direction of each arrow is determined by the sign of the derivative <m>x^\prime</m>, i.e., the sign of <m>f(x) = -x^2 + 7x - 10</m>.
        This is easily determined by just graphing <m>f(x)</m> on the phase diagram like so:

          <p>
            Consider a population of fish that obeys the logistic equation
            <me>\dv{P}{t} = 2P(30 - P)</me>
            where <m>P(t)</m> is the population of fish (in thousands) after <m>t</m> years.
            Suppose that the population is also harvested at some rate <m>h</m> (in thousands per year).
            What is the maximum sustainable rate of harvesting?
          </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p>
            To account for the harvesting, we need to modify the ODE:
            <me>\dv{P}{t} = 2P(30 - P) - h.</me>
            The harvesting will be sustainable as long as the population does not become extinct.
            To determine this long term behavior, we'll find the critical points and set up a phase diagram.

          <p>
            The critical points are given by
            <me>P = 15 \pm \sqrt{3600 - 8h}</me>
            by the quadratic formula.
            We now have three cases to consider: <m>3600 - 8h \lt 0, 3600 - 8h = 0, 3600 - 8h \gt 0.</m>
            In terms of <m>h</m>, these reduce to <m>h \lt 450, h = 450, h \gt 450</m>.

                  We interpret the phase diagram as follows: if <m>P</m> is less than <p>15,000</p> then the population will collapse to extinction.
                  Otherwise, the population will stabilize at <m>15,000</m>.
                  This type of critical point is often called <term>semi-stable.</term>

                  Finally, consider the case <m>h \gt 450</m>.
                  Then we have no (real) critical points.
                  Since imaginary populations don't make sense in this model, there is no sustainable population.
                  No matter how large the initial population, it will eventually go extinct if harvested at a rate greater than <m>450</m>.

          <p>
              By the above, the largest sustainable harvesting rate is <m>h = 450,</m> as long as <m>P_{0}\geq 15</m>.

          Given the autonomous ODE <m>\dv{x}{t} = f(x)</m>, we saw above that we can qualify the behavior of equilibrium solutions by setting up a phase diagram.
          We can go a step further and actually qualify the growth of solutions that are "near" equilibrium solutions.
          In particular, we have the following theorem.

      <theorem xml:id="theorem-linear-stability-analysis">
        <title>Linear Stability Analysis</title>

        <statement>
          <p>
              Suppose <m>\dv{x}{t} = f(x)</m> where <m>f(x)</m> is continuously differentiable, and let <m>x^{*}</m> denote a critical point/equilibrium solution of the ODE.
              If <m>f^\prime(x^{*}) \lt 0</m>, then <m>x^{*}</m> is stable and solutions near <m>x^{*}</m> will move exponentially towards <m>x^{*}</m>.
              If <m>f^\prime(x^{*}) \gt 0</m>, then <m>x^{*}</m> is unstable and solutions near <m>x^{*}</m> will move exponentially away from <m>x^{*}</m>.
            If <m>f^\prime(x^{*}) = 0</m>, then more advanced methods are required.

        <title>Classifying the Critical Points of the Logistic Equation</title>

        <statement>
          <p>
            Classify the critical points of the logistic equation as stable or unstable.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Recall that the logistic equation is given by <m>P^\prime = kP(M-P) = f(P)</m> for (we'll assume) positive constants <m>k,M</m>.
            From here, we clearly see that the critical points are <m>P = 0</m> and <m>P = M</m> (which makes sense from a population standpoint!).
            We could set up a phase diagram to determine stability, but we'll use <xref ref="theorem-linear-stability-analysis" text="type-global" /> instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since <m>f^\prime(P) = k(M-P) - kP</m>, we see that
            <md>
              <mrow>f^\prime(0) &amp; = kM \gt 0</mrow>
              <mrow>f^\prime(M) &amp; = -kM \lt 0 </mrow>
            </md>
            Hence <m>P = 0</m> is unstable, while <m>P = M</m> is stable.
