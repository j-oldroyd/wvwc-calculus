  <title>Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Equations of the form <m>y=f(x)</m> are well-suited for describing one-dimensional relationships between quantities but lose their effectiveness in higher dimensions.
      However, higher dimensional problems (such as describing motion through space) require more complicated models.
      We will therefore focus on extending the calculus concepts we've already developed for one-dimensional problems to two- and three-dimensional models.

    <title>Parametric Equations</title>
    <p>
      If a particle is moving in two dimensions (i.e., the <m>xy</m>-plane), then it makes sense to write the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-coordinates of its <term>trajectory</term> in terms of time <m>t</m>:
      <md>
        <mrow>x \amp = x(t) </mrow>
        <mrow>y \amp = y(t) </mrow>
      </md>.
      We can use <term>parametric equations</term> to describe the resulting <term>parametric curves</term>.
      For example, the parametric equations
      <md>
        <mrow>x \amp = 2t^{2}-1 </mrow>
        <mrow>y \amp = t+1 </mrow>
        <mrow>-2 \amp \leq t\leq 2 </mrow>
      </md>
      produce the following parametric curve in the <m>xy</m>-plane.

    <p>
      Note that the parametric curve above has a <em>starting point</em> and an <em>ending point</em>, determined by the interval of values for <m>t</m>.
      When plotting parametric curves, we'll often specify a corresponding interval of values for <m>t</m>.
      This curve can also be plotted relatively painlessly with SymPy, as below:
    </p>
    <sage>
      <input>
        import sympy as sp
        from sympy.plotting import plot_parametric

        t = sp.symbols('t')
        plot_parametric(2 * t**2 - 1, t + 1, (t, -2, 2))
      </input>
    </sage>
    <p>
      A set of parametric equations (along with a corresponding interval of values for <m>t</m>) can be viewed as defining a single function <m>f(t)</m> that assigns points in the <m>xy</m>-plane to real numbers <m>t</m>.
      We'll introduce some notation that will come in handy later: let <m>\mathbb{R}</m> denote the set of real numbers (also known as <term>scalars</term>), and let <m>\mathbb{R}^{2}</m> denote the <m>xy</m>-plane.
      Then a set of parametric equations describes a function from <m>\mathbb{R}</m> (specifically, an interval in <m>\mathbb{R}</m>) to <m>\mathbb{R}^{2}</m>.
      We'll see more of this in the following chapters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plotting points and plugging them into parametric equations can be tedious.
      Another way to describe a parametric curve is to eliminate parameters.

      <title>Eliminating parameters</title>

          Rewrite the parametric equations
        </p>
        <md>

          <mrow>y \amp = t+1 </mrow>
        </md>
        as a single <em>Cartesian</em> equation, i.e., eliminate the parameter <m>t</m>.
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First, solve for <m>t</m> in the second equation to get <m>t = y-1</m>.
          If we plug this into the first equation, we get an equation in <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> alone:
        </p>
        <me>x = 2(y-1)^{2}-1.</me>
        <p>
          We can see from this equation that the original parametric equations should trace out a rightward opening parabola.
          Note however that this equation tells us nothing about which portion of the parabola is traced out.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="example-parameterizing-a-line-segment">
      <title>Parameterizing a Line Segment</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Give a set of parametric equations and a corresponding interval that trace out the line segment starting at <m>(1,-3)</m> and ending at <m>(-2,4)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First, we'll try to figure out what our equations should look like.
          We know that <m>x</m> starts at <m>1</m> and <m>y</m> starts at <m>-3</m> on this segment, so a reasonable guess is
          <md>
            <mrow>x \amp = 1 + at </mrow>
            <mrow>y \amp = -3 + bt </mrow>
          </md>
          for some unknown constants <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
          To find <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, we'll specify the interval of values we want <m>t</m> to range over.
          To make things easier, let's fix <m>t</m> between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>.
          Then at <m>t = 1</m> we need to have
          <md>
            <mrow>x \amp = 1 + a = -2 </mrow>
            <mrow>y \amp = -3 + b = 4 </mrow>
          </md>
          which gives <m>a = -3</m> and <m>b = 7</m>.
          Therefore the line segment is parameterized by
          <md>
            <mrow>x \amp = 1 - 3t </mrow>
            <mrow>y \amp = -3 + 7t </mrow>
            <mrow>0 \amp \leq t\leq 1 </mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can also rewrite these equations in terms of the starting and ending values of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
          In particular, we have
          <md>
            <mrow>x \amp = 1(1 - t) + (-2)t </mrow>
            <mrow>y \amp = -3(1 - t) + 4t </mrow>
            <mrow>0 \amp \leq t\leq 1 </mrow>
          </md>.
          To see why this works, note that the second term in each equation vanishes at <m>t = 0</m>, leaving the starting value for each coordinate.
          Likewise, the first term in each equation vanishes at <m>t = 1</m>, leaving the terminal value for each coordinate.
          Expanding the equations gives the previous result.
          Note that this method only works if you select <m>[0,1]</m> as your interval of values for <m>t</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      Parametric equations are especially useful for tracing movement along a curve that is not the graph of a function, like a circle.
      In particular, a circle of radius <m>r</m> centered at <m>(h,k)</m> is traced out by the parametric equations
      <md>
        <mrow>x \amp = h + r\cos t </mrow>
        <mrow>y \amp = k + r\sin t </mrow>
      </md>
      over the interval <m>0\leq t\leq 2\pi</m>.

      <title>Parametric Equations for Motion on a Circle</title>
      <statement>

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          This problem has a lot to unpack, but we know the basic form of our equations will be
          <me>x = 3 + 3\cos t\qq{and} y = -2 + 3\sin t</me>.
          Since we want to start at <m>(6,-2)</m>, we can let <m>t = 0</m> be our starting value.
          And since we want to move around the circle <m>3</m> times, we'll let <m>t</m> vary from <m>0</m> to <m>6\pi</m>.
          Finally, to get clockwise motion we need to replace <m>t</m> with <m>-t</m>, getting

      <title>Tangent Lines to Parametric Curves</title>
      <p>
        We have an idea of how to represent curves in the <m>xy</m>-plane using parametric equations.
        What we'd like to do now is to figure out how to do calculus with parametric equations.
        To start, we'll find the slope of a parametric curve at some value <m>t</m>.
        Suppose that
        <md>
          <mrow>x \amp = f(t) </mrow>
          <mrow>y \amp = g(t) </mrow>
        </md>.
        Then we can find the slope <m>\dv{y}{x}</m> using the chain rule:
        <me>\dv{y}{t} = \dv{y}{x}\dv{x}{t}</me>
        and so <m>\dv{y}{x} = \dv{y}{t}/\dv{x}{t} = g'(t)/f'(t)</m>, assuming that <m>g'(t)\neq0</m>.

            trace out a <term>cycloid</term>, also known as the <term>brachistochrone</term> or <term>curve of fastest descent</term>.
            Find the values of <m>t</m> for which this curve has a cusp.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            First, note that a curve cannot be differentiable at a cusp.
            So we can try to find the cusps by looking at where <m>\dv{y}{x}</m> fails to exist.
            This occurs precisely at <m>t = 2k\pi</m> for any integer <m>k</m>.
            Hence the cycloid should have a cusp at these values of <m>t</m>.

      <title>Area Under Parametric Curves</title>
      <p>
        We can also find areas by using <m>u</m>-substitution and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
        If <m>y = F(x)</m>, then the area under the curve <m>y=F(x)</m> from <m>x=a</m> to <m>x=b</m> is given by <m>\int_{a}^{b} F(x)\,dx</m>.

        </md>
        then <m>y = F(x) = F(f(t)) = g(t)</m> and <m>dx = f'(t)\,dt</m>. If the curve goes from <m>x=a</m> to <m>x=b</m> exactly once as <m>t</m> goes from <m>\alpha</m> to <m>\beta</m>, then the area under the curve is given by

      <title>Introducing Polar Coordinates</title>
      <p>
        We typically use <term>Cartesian</term> or <term>rectangular</term> coordinates to plot points. 
        However, this can lead to issues if we have a graph that isn't rectangular. 
        For example, the circle has a simple geometric description based on its center and radius, but in Cartesian coordinates it can be difficult to work with since every point on the (unit) circle takes the form <m>(x,\pm\sqrt{1-x^{2}})</m>. 
        This square root makes integrals and derivatives complicated. The main problem lies in the fact that we are trying to describe a circle using a rectangular coordinate system. 
        So our goal in this section is to find a more suitable coordinate system for circles.
      </p>
      <p>
        A circle can be described as the set of all points some fixed distance <m>r</m> from a given point, and we can specify any point on the circle by using an angle <m>\theta</m>:

        Any point <m>P</m> on the circle can be described solely using the distance <m>r</m> and the direction <m>\theta</m>.
        This leads directly to the idea of polar coordinates. In polar coordinates, the <m>xy</m>-plane is replaced with an <m>r\theta</m>-plane, or <term>polar plane</term>.
        Each point in the polar plane has the form <m>(r,\theta)</m>, where the <term>radial coordinate</term> <m>r</m> denotes the distance from the origin, or <term> pole</term>, and the <term>angular coordinate</term> <m>\theta</m> determines the angle the point makes with the horizontal <term>polar axis</term>.
        The polar axis replaces the positive <m>x</m>-axis from Cartesian coordinates:

        In polar coordinates, positive <m>\theta</m> correspond to counterclockwise direction, and negative <m>\theta</m> correspond to clockwise direction.
        We also allow for <m>r</m> to be negative: this just means go in the direction opposite of <m>\theta</m>.

          Suppose we want to plot the points <m>(3,\pi), (-2,\frac{\pi}{4})</m> and <m>(2,\frac{5\pi}{4}).</m>
          We can do so in the polar plane by remembering that the first coordinate is distance from the pole, and the second coordinate is direction from the polar axis.
          If we plot these points, we see that <m>(-2,\frac{\pi}{4})</m> and <m>(2,\frac{5\pi}{4})</m> actually represent the same point. This is typical of polar coordinates: every point has, in general, infinitely many representations.

        To find the area of a region swept out by a polar curve, we need to reinvent the integral so to speak.
        In Cartesian coordinates, the integral was based on using rectangles to approximate areas. For polar coordinates, it makes more sense to use circular sectors.
