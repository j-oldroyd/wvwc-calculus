        <p>
            If a function is differentiable, then its derivative gives
            us information about how that function is changing.  This
            information is important in many different applications of
            calculus.

        <p>
          Suppose we graph the tangent line to
          <m>y=\sqrt{x}</m> at
            <m>x=4</m>.  The equation of this line will be
            <me>
                y-2 = \frac{x-4}{4}\quad\text{or}\quad y= 2 + \frac{x-4}{4}
            </me>.  If we look at the tangent line next to the graph,
            we'll see that the line is very close to the graph
            of <m>y=\sqrt{x}</m> if <m>x</m> is very close
            to <m>4</m>.  So we can use the equation of the tangent
            line to approximate <m>y=\sqrt{x}</m> when <m>x</m> is
            near <m>4</m>.  For example, we can say that
            <me>
                \sqrt{4.2} \approx 2 + \frac{4.2 - 4}{4} = 2.05
            </me>.
            We call this the <term>linear approximation</term> of <m>\sqrt{x}</m> at <m>4</m>.

            <solution>
                <p>
                    We want to estimate this using a linear
                    approximation, and we want to make sure the linear
                    approximation is easy to set up.  This means we
                    want to base the linear approximation at a value
                    of <m>a</m> that both tangent and its derivative
                    are relatively easy to compute at, and is also
                    close to <m>\pi+\frac{3}{49}</m>.  So we'll
                    pick <m>a=\pi</m> and find the linear
                    approximation to <m>\tan x</m> at <m>a = \pi</m>:
                    Set <m>f(x) = \tan x</m>.  Then
                    <md>

                    million to estimate the population of the US in

            <solution>
                <p>
                    Recall that <m>P(t)</m> in
                    <xref ref="example-a-differential-equation"
                    text="type-global" /> represented the population
                    of the US (in millions) <m>t</m> years after 1990.
                    To estimate the population in 2020, we want to
                    find the linearization of <m>P</m> at <m>t =
                    27</m>.  This is given by

                        L(t) = P(27) + P'(27)(t - 27)
                    </me>.
                    Since <m>P(27) = 323.1</m> and
                    <me>
                        P^\prime(27) = \frac{1}{23500}P(532-P) =
                        \frac{1}{23500}(323.1)(532-323.1) = 2.9

                    we have

                        L(t) = 323.1 + 2.9(t-27)
                    </me>.
                    Hence the population of the US in 2020 should be

                        L(30) = 323.1 + 2.9\cdot3 = 331.8

                    prefix="milli"/></quantity>?
                </p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
                <p>
                    First, let's assign names to all of the changing
                    quantities in this problem:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>V &amp; = \text{volume} </mrow>
                        <mrow>r &amp; = \text{radius} </mrow>
                    </md>.  Note that we're considering <m>V</m>
                    and <m>r</m> to be functions of time, i.e.
                    <m>V = V(t)</m> and <m>r=r(t)</m>, where <m>t</m>
                    is in seconds.  Then we're given that <m>r' =
                    4</m> and we need to find <m>V'</m>
                    when <m>r=13</m>.  To do this, we had better find
                    some relationship between <m>V</m> and <m>r</m>.
                    We can find this by looking at the volume formula
                    for a sphere:
                    <me>
                        V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}
                    </me>.  This equation relates <m>r</m>
                    and <m>V</m>, and if we take the derivatives of
                    both sides with respect to time <m>t</m> (using
                    implicit differentiation) then we get an equation
                    relating <m>V'</m> and <m>r'</m>.  So let's do
                    that:
                    <me>
                        V' = 4\pi r^{2}r'
                    </me>
                    Now we can plug in our given information to get
                    <me>
                        V' = 4\pi(13^{2})(4) = 2704\pi
                    </me>.

                    So the volume is increasing at a rate
                    of <quantity><mag>2704\pi</mag><unit base="meter"
                    prefix="milli"
                    exp="3"/><per base="second"/></quantity>.
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <p>
            Note that we <em>never</em> found what <m>V(t)</m>
            and <m>r(t)</m> were in
            <xref ref="example-changing-volume-on-a-sphere"
            text="type-global" />, but we didn't need to.  All we
            needed to find was a relationship between the two changing
            quantities, i.e.  the two derivatives, to answer the
            question.

                    what is the rate at which water is being poured
                    into the tank?

            <solution>
                <p>
                    We have a <em>lot</em> of information to process
                    here, so we'll take things a step at a time.  The
                    changing quantities are
                    <md>
                        <mrow>h(t) &amp; = \text{height of water} </mrow>
                        <mrow>r(t) &amp; = \text{radius of water} </mrow>
                        <mrow>V(t) &amp; = \text{volume of water} </mrow>
                    </md>
                    where <m>t</m> is in minutes.  We need to find the
                    rate at which water is entering the tank, so let's
                    call this mystery number <m>C</m>.  Then all we
                    know about <m>C</m> is that it's related to the
                    rate that the volume is changing.  In particular,
                    we should have <m>V' = C - 10000</m>.  So to
                    find <m>C</m> we need to find <m>V'</m>, which
                    means we need to set up a relationship
                    between <m>V</m> and the other changing quantities
                    to determine how exactly <m>V</m> is changing,
                    using the fact that <m>h' = 20</m>
                    when <m>h=200</m> (after converting to
                    centimeters).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Using the fact that the water is in a conical
                    tank, we can use the formula for the volume of a
                    cone to say that <m>V = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^{2}h</m>.
                    If we differentiate both sides with respect
                    to <m>t</m>, then we get
                    <me>
                        V' = \frac{1}{3}\pi (2rr'h + r^{2}h')
                    </me>.  Unfortunately, we don't have any
                    information on <m>r</m> or <m>r'</m> that we can
                    use, just information on <m>h</m> and <m>h'</m>.
                    So we need to get <m>r</m> in terms of <m>h</m>.
                    By similar triangles, we can say
                    that <m>\frac{r}{h} = \frac{200}{600} =
                    \frac{1}{3}</m>, and so <m>r = \frac{h}{3}</m> and
                    likewise <m>r' = \frac{h'}{3}</m>.  Hence
                    <me>
                        V' = \frac{1}{3}\pi (2rr'h + r^{2}h') =
                        \frac{1}{3}\pi \left(2\frac{h^{2}h'}{9} +
                        \frac{h^{2}h'}{9}\right)
                    </me>
                    which boils down to
                    <me>
                        V' = \frac{h^{2}h'}{9}\pi = \frac{800000\pi}{9}
                    </me>.

            Consider the important limit <m>\lim_{x\to0}\frac{\sin
            x}{x}</m>.  If we try to plug in <m>x=0</m>, we
            get <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>, which is undefined.  However, we
            can prove using geometry that the limit is <m>1</m>.  As
            another example,
            consider <m>\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{1-x^{3}}{4x^{3}}</m>.
            Once again, if we try to plug the limit in we get an
            expression of the form <m>\frac{-\infty}{\infty}</m>.
            However, the limit is just <m>-\frac{1}{4}</m>, which we
            can find using algebra.
        </p>
        <p>
            Limits of the form <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>
            or <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m> are known
            as <term>indeterminate forms</term>.  There is no
            restriction whatsoever on what value a limit involving an
            indeterminate form may take, or even that it has to exist
            at all.

            The goal of this section is to determine a method that can

            There are three other indeterminate forms that
            L'Hospital's Rule can help us with (after some
            algebra): <m>1^{\infty}, \infty^{0}</m> and <m>0^{0}</m>.
            All of these can be found by first using logarithms.

                    This limit is a <m>1^{\infty}</m> indeterminate
                    form.  We'll try taking logarithms to rewrite it
                    as a <m>0\cdot\infty</m> form, so set <m>y =
                    \lim_{x\to\infty}\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)^{x}</m>.
                    Then

                    is a <m>0\cdot\infty</m> form.  We can use
                    L'Hospital's by rewriting this limit at
                    a <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> form
                    or <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m>.  Either way, we
                    get <m>\ln y = 1</m> and so the original limit

            So if we can find where a function has local extrema, then

                    yet because we have too many variables.  However,
                    we can solve for <m>h</m> in terms of <m>x</m> by
                    using the volume constraint.  Since the volume of
                    the box is <m>x^{2}h = 32000,</m> this gives <m>h
                    = \frac{32000}{x^{2}}.</m> So the quantity we need
                    to minimize is
                    <me>f(x) = x^{2} + 4xh = x^{2} + \frac{128000}{x}.</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To minimize this, we find the critical points by
                    solving <m>f^{\prime}(x) = 0</m>.  This gives,
                    after some algebra, <m>x = 40</m>.  Now we need to
                    be careful here! We only have a critical point at
                    this step.  We need to make an argument now as to
                    why this critical point should be an absolute
                    minimum of <m>f(x)</m>.  One way to do this is by
                    setting up a sign chart for <m>f^{\prime}(x)</m>.
                    If we do this, then we see that <m>f' &lt; 0</m>
                    for <m>x</m> in <m>(0,40)</m>, while <m>f' &gt;
                    0</m> for <m>x</m> in <m>(40,\infty)</m>.  If we
                    think about what this tells us of the graph
                    of <m>f(x)</m>, we see that <m>x=40</m> must
                    minimize <m>f(x)</m>, at least for <m>x &gt;
                    0</m>.  So the dimensions that minimize the cost
                    of building this box
                    are <m>40\times40\times20</m>.

                <p>
                    This is an optimization problem since we're trying
                    to maximize distance.  There are two things we
                    need to do:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Find the function we need to optimize.</li>
                        <li>Find the extrema.</li>
                    </ol>
                    The function we need to optimize is just the
                    distance function.  In particular, if <m>(x,y)</m>
                    is a point on the ellipse then we need to maximize
                    <me>d = \sqrt{(x-1)^{2} + (y-0)^{2}}.</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, we have a constraint that <m>(x,y)</m> must
                    satisfy; namely, this must lie on the
                    ellipse <m>4x^{2} + y^{2} = 4</m>.  This means
                    that <m>y^{2} = 4 - 4x^{2}</m>, and if we plug
                    this into our distance function we get
                    <me>d = \sqrt{(x-1)^{2} + (y-0)^{2}} =
                    \sqrt{(x-1)^{2} + 4 - 4x^{2}}.</me> Now here's a
                    trick we can use: maximizing <m>d</m> is the same
                    thing as maximizing <m>d^{2}</m>, but <m>d^{2}</m>
                    is <em>much</em> nicer to work with algebraically.
                    So instead of maximizing <m>d</m>, we'll maximize
                    the function
                    <me>f(x) = d^{2} = (x-1)^{2} + 4 - 4x^{2}.</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We'll start by finding it's local extrema, which
                    means we need to find the critical points.  These
                    are the solutions of <m>f^{\prime}(x) = 0</m>.
                    Since
                    <me>f^{\prime}(x) = 2x - 2 - 8x = -6x - 2,</me> we
                    see that the only critical point is <m>x =
                    -\frac{1}{3}</m>.  Since <m>f''(x) = -6 &lt;
                    0</m>, this means that <m>x = -\frac{1}{3}</m>
                    gives us a local maximum of <m>f(x)</m> by the
                    second derivative test.  In fact, we can go
                    further: this must be an absolute maximum
                    of <m>f(x)</m>, since <m>f(x)</m> is always
                    concave down (it's actually a parabola).
                </p>
                <p>
                    So the point on the ellipse <m>4x^{2} + y^{2} =
                    4</m> farthest from <m>(1,0)</m>
                    has <m>x</m>-coordinate equal
                    to <m>-\frac{1}{3}</m>.  This means that the
                    corresponding <m>y</m>-coordinate is <m>y =
                    \pm\frac{2\sqrt{5}}{3},</m> so the points on the
                    ellipse that are the farthest from <m>(1,0)</m>
                    are the points <m>(-\frac{1}{3},
                    -\frac{2\sqrt{5}}{3}), (-\frac{1}{3},
                    \frac{2\sqrt{5}}{3}).</m>

                complicated functions with simpler, linear models.  In
                essence, we use the derivative of a function to tell
                us how much to change a given value of the function in
                order to estimate that function.  There is one problem
                with this approach, at least currently.  We have good
                reason to suspect that our approximations are close to
                the exact values in certain circumstances, but we
                don't know how close.  The goal of this section is to
                derive an estimate for the derivative that can help us
                to find more precise approximations.

                        First, we should find <m>L(x)</m>, which from
                        <xref ref="section-linear-approximations"
                        text="type-global" /> is just

                        error we need to estimate is <m>|f(x) -
                        L(x)|</m>, for <m>x</m> in <m>[9,16]</m>.  So
                        we'll set <m>g(x) = f(x) - L(x)</m> and
                        let <m>x</m> be some number in <m>[9,16]</m>.
                        By <xref ref="theorem-mean-value-theorem"
                        text="type-global" />, there exists some
                        number <m>c</m> in <m>(9,x)</m> such that
                        <me>g(x) - g(9) = g'(c)(x-9).</me>
                        Now, <m>g(9) = 0</m> and <m>g'(c) =
                        \frac{1}{2\sqrt{c}} - \frac{1}{6}</m>.  So the
                        above equation becomes
                        <me>f(x) - L(x) = \left(\frac{1}{2\sqrt{c}} -
                        \frac{1}{6}\right)(x-9).</me>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, we don't know anything about <m>c</m>
                        aside from the fact that it lives
                        in <m>(9,16)</m>.  However, we do have an
                        expression for <m>|f(x) - L(x)|</m> now:
                        <md>
                            <mrow>|f(x) - L(x)| &amp; = \left|\left(\frac{1}{2\sqrt{c}} - \frac{1}{6}\right)(x-9)\right|</mrow>

                        </md>
                        So if <m>x</m> is in <m>[9,16]</m>, then the
                        error <m>|f(x) - L(x)|</m> is <em>at

                        The idea of the proof is to use

            Recall that if <m>f(x)</m> is a function and <m>f^{\prime}(x)</m> exists, then <m>f^{\prime}(c) &gt; 0</m> for some <m>c</m> means that <m>f</m> is increasing at <m>c</m>, while <m>f^{\prime}(c) &lt; 0</m> means that <m>f</m> is decreasing at <m>c</m>.
            Now, suppose that <m>c</m> is a critical point of <m>f(x)</m>.
            Then <m>f^{\prime}(c) = 0</m>.
            If <m>f^{\prime}</m> changes sign from negative to positive, then <m>f^{\prime}(c)</m> is a local minimum.
            Conversely, if <m>f^{\prime}</m> changes sign from positive to negative, then <m>f^{\prime}(c)</m> is a local maximum.
            This is the <term>first derivative test</term>.

                    We can answer all of these questions by setting up a sign chart for
                    <me>f^{\prime}(x) = x^{3}e^{-x}(4-x)</me>.
                    The critical points are <m>x=0,4</m>, and <m>f^{\prime} &lt; 0</m> on <m>(-\infty,0)\cup(4,\infty)</m> and <m>f^{\prime} &gt; 0</m> on <m>(0,4)</m>.
                    So <m>f</m> is decreasing on the first set of intervals, increasing on <m>(0,4)</m>, <m>f</m> has a local maximum at <m>x=4</m> and a local minimum at <m>x=0</m>.

                    We need to find the critical points, which means we need to find <m>G^{\prime}(x)</m>:
                    <me>G^{\prime}(x) = \frac{(x-1)(2x) - x^{2}}{(x-1)^{2}} = \frac{x(x-2)}{(x-1)^{2}}.</me>
                    So the critical points are <m>x=0,1,2</m>.
                    Note that <m>x=1</m> <em>cannot</em> be a local extreme value of <m>G</m> since it's not in the domain of <m>G</m>.
                    However, we still need to include it in our sign chart.
                    If we do so, we find that <m>G</m> has a local minimum at <m>x=2</m> and a local maximum at <m>x=0</m> by the first derivative test.

        <p>
            One benefit of the first derivative test is that we only need to compute first derivatives to use it.
            However, if a function has a second derivative, then it's often easier to use the concavity of the graph at a critical point to determine whether a critical point is a local maximum or minimum.
            In particular, if <m>f(x)</m> is a function and <m>f''(x)</m> is continuous near the critical point <m>c</m> (so <m>f^{\prime}(c) = 0</m>), then <m>f(c)</m> is a local minimum if <m>f''(c) &gt; 0</m> and <m>f(c)</m> is a local maximum if <m>f''(c) &lt; 0</m>.
            This is the <term>second derivative test</term>.

                    forces <m>x=0,\pm1</m>.

            From the graph of this function it's clearly concave up everywhere even though the <m>f''(0) = 0</m>.
            The problem here is that <m>f''(x) = 12x^2</m> doesn't change sign at <m>x = 0</m>, and so this point can't be an inflection point.

        <title>Newton's Method</title>
        <p>
            Consider a differentiable function <m>f(x)</m>, and suppose we want to find a root of <m>f(x)</m>, which is a number <m>x_{0}</m> such that <m>f(x_{0}) = 0</m>.
            In some cases this is very easy (like <m>f(x) = x^{2} + 2x + 1</m>), but in others this may be more complicated (such as <m>f(x) = x^{5} - x  - 1</m>).
            So we'd like to find a way to <em>approximate</em> the root <m>x_{0}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <term>Newton's Method</term> begins as follows: pick some starting point, or guess, <m>x_{1}</m>.
            Then draw the tangent line <m>L</m> to the graph of <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x_{1}</m>.
            Now, the <m>x</m>-intercept of this line may not be a root, but hopefully it'll be closer to the root.
            So call this point <m>x_{2}</m>.
            We can solve for <m>x_{2}</m> (if <m>f^{\prime}(x_{1})\neq0</m>) to get
            <me>x_{2} = x_{1} - \frac{f(x_{1})}{f^{\prime}(x_{1})}.</me>
            Now, at this point <m>x_{2}</m> is (hopefully!) a better approximation to the root <m>x_{0}</m> than <m>x_{1}</m>, and we can run through the same procedure to get a new point <m>x_{3}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In general, we can get a <term>sequence</term> of approximations <m>x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}</m> to the root <m>x_{0}</m> by using the formula
            <me>x_{n+1} = x_{n} - \frac{f(x_{n})}{f^{\prime}(x_{n})},</me>
            as long as <m>f^{\prime}(x_{n}) \neq0</m>.

                    We need to find a function <m>f(x)</m> for which <m>f(\pi) = 0</m>.
                    Perhaps the easiest is <m>f(x) = \sin x</m>.
                    Now, to use Newton's method we also need a starting guess.
                    We'll pick <m>x_{1} = 3</m> since this is close to <m>\pi</m>.
                    Then

                <p>
                    To use Newton's method, we need to come up with a function <m>f(x)</m> whose root is <m>\sqrt{a}</m>.
                    A simple choice for this is <m>f(x) = x^{2} - a</m>, since <m>f(\sqrt{a}) = 0</m>.
                    Now, if we're getting some sequence <m>x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}</m> from Newton's method then the next term in the sequence is
                    <me>x_{n+1} = x_{n} - \frac{f(x_{n})}{f^{\prime}(x_{n})} = x_{n} - \frac{x_{n}^{2} - a}{2x_{n}}.</me>
                    After some algebra, we can rewrite this as
                    <me>x_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2}\left(x_{n} + \frac{a}{x_{n}}\right).</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can actually test this algorithm out.
                    Say we want to approximate <m>\sqrt{5}</m>.
                    A reasonable guess would be <m>x_{1} = 2</m>, since this should be close to <m>\sqrt{5}</m>.
                    Then we get
                    <md>
                        <mrow>x_{2} &amp; = \frac{1}{2}\left(2 + \frac{5}{2}\right) = 2.25 </mrow>
                        <mrow>x_{3} &amp; = \frac{1}{2}\left(2.25 + \frac{5}{2.25}\right) \approx 2.236111111 </mrow>
                        <mrow>x_{4} &amp; \approx 2.236067978 </mrow>
                        <mrow>x_{5} &amp; \approx 2.236067977 </mrow>
                    </md>
                    So it looks like <m>\sqrt{5}\approx 2.23606797</m>, and indeed this is quite close to the actual value of <m>\sqrt{5} = 2.236067977\ldots</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can go one step further for this algorithm.
                    If <m>x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n},\ldots</m> is the sequence we obtain using Newton's method for approximating <m>\sqrt{a}</m>, then as we saw earlier
                    <me>x_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2}\left(x_{n} + \frac{a}{x_{n}}\right).</me>
                    Now, assume that <m>\lim_{n\to\infty}x_{n}</m> exists and is nonzero, and call it <m>s</m>.
                    Then
                    <me>\lim_{n\to\infty}x_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\lim_{n\to\infty}x_{n} + \frac{a}{\lim_{n\to\infty}x_{n}}\right)</me>
                    becomes
                    <me>s = \frac{1}{2}\left(s + \frac{a}{s}\right)</me>
                    which we can rearrange to get
                    <me>s^{2} = \frac{1}{2}(s^{2} + a),</me>
                    or just <m>s^{2} = a</m>.
                    Hence <m>s = \pm\sqrt{a}</m>.

            In fact, this describes all possible antiderivatives of <m>\cos x</m>.
            This suggests the following theorem.

                    Then the most general antiderivative of <m>f(x)</m> is
                    <me>F(x) + C</me>
                    where <m>C</m> is an arbitrary constant.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <proof>
                <p>
                    It might not seem like this statement requires a proof, but it does!
                    We can check very easily that every function of the form <m>F(x)+C</m> is an antiderivative of <m>f(x)</m>, but how do we know every antiderivative takes this form?
                    To prove this, let <m>G(x)</m> be an arbitrary antiderivative of <m>f(x)</m>.
                    Then we need to show that <m>G(x) = F(x) + C</m>, or equivalently that <m>G(x) - F(x) = C</m>.
                    We can do this by taking the derivative of <m>G(x) - F(x)</m> to get
                    <me>G'(x) - F^{\prime}x) = f(x) - f(x) = 0,</me>
                    and so by <xref ref="theorem-zero-derivative-theorem" text="type-global" /> we know that <m>G(x) - F(x)</m> must be constant on <m>I</m>.
                    Hence <m>G(x) - F(x) = C</m> for some constant <m>C</m>, or equivalently <m>G(x) = F(x)+C</m>.
                    Therefore <em>every</em> antiderivative of <m>f(x)</m> can be written as <m>F(x) + C</m>.
                </p>
            </proof>

            It might seem superfluous, but typically when dealing with models requiring us to find antiderivatives we'll want to find the most general antiderivative somewhere along the way.

                <p>
                    We have two cases we need to consider, since the domain of <m>f(x)</m> consists of two intervals.
                    First, suppose that <m>x</m> is in <m>(0,\infty)</m>.
                    Then we know that <m>\dv{}{x}\ln x = \frac{1}{x}</m>, so on this interval the most general antiderivative of <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> is <m>\ln x + C_{1}</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now let <m>x</m> be in <m>(-\infty,0)</m>.
                    Then <m>\ln x</m> isn't defined here.
                    However, we can write
                    <me>\frac{1}{x} = -\frac{1}{-x},</me>
                    and if <m>x &lt; 0</m> then <m>-x &gt; 0</m> and <m>\ln(-x)</m> is defined, and in fact
                    <me>\dv{}{x}\ln(-x) = -\frac{1}{(-x)} = \frac{1}{x}.</me>
                    So the most general antiderivative of <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> on <m>(-\infty,0)</m> is <m>\ln(-x) + C_{2}</m>.
                    Putting this all together, we can say that the most general antiderivative of <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m> is given by
                    <me>F(x) = \begin{cases} \ln x + C_{1} &amp; x &gt; 0 \\ \ln(-x) + C_{2} &amp; x &lt; 0\end{cases}.</me>
                    If we know that we're only selecting values of <m>x</m> with the same sign, then we can just say that the antiderivative of <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> is <m>\ln|x| + C</m>.

                    The second is a little more complicated but still not too bad.
                    Since <m>\dv{}{t}\sec t = \sec t\tan t</m>, a good guess for an antiderivative of <m>-2\sec3t\tan3t</m> would be <m>-2\sec3t.</m>
                    However, the derivative of this is <m>-6\sec3t\tan3t</m>, so we're off by a factor of <m>3</m>.
                    So we just need to divide our guess by <m>3</m> to correct for this.
                    Hence the general antiderivative of <m>-2\sec3t\tan3t</m> is <m>-\frac{2}{3}\sec3t</m>.

            <title>Falling objects</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    An object is dropped from a height of <quantity><mag>100</mag><unit base="meter"/></quantity> above sea level and falls with downward acceleration equal to <quantity><mag>9.8</mag><unit base="meter"/><per base="second" exp="2"/></quantity>.
                    Find the height <m>h(t)</m> of the object <m>t</m> seconds after it's dropped.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    Take downward to be the negative direction and sea level to be <m>h=0</m>.
                    Since acceleration is the second derivative of position, then the position (i.e. height) of the object should be the second <em>antiderivative</em> of acceleration.
                    At this step, it's tempting to say that since <m>h''(t) = -9.8</m>, we have
                    <me>h^{\prime}t) = -9.8t\quad\text{and}\quad h(t) = -4.9 t^{2}</me>.
                    And indeed, <m>-4.9t^{2}</m> is a function whose second derivative is <m>-9.8</m>.
                    However, we have a slight problem here.
                    We know that <m>h(0) = 100</m> and <m>h^{\prime}0) = 0</m>.
                    If <m>h(t) = -4.9t^{2}</m>, then it's impossible for <m>h(0)</m> to equal <m>100</m>.
                    The problem here is we forgot about the arbitrary constants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To get an accurate expression for <m>h(t)</m>, we go back to <m>h''(t) = -9.8</m>.
                    Then <m>h^{\prime}t) = -9.8t+C_{1}</m> for some constant <m>C_{1}</m>.
                    Since <m>h^{\prime}0) = 0</m>, this forces <m>C_{1} = 0</m>.
                    So we have <m>h^{\prime}t) = -9.8t</m>.
                    Now we antidifferentiate one more time to get <m>h(t) = -4.9t^{2} + C_{2}</m>.
                    Since <m>h(0) = 100</m>, this forces <m>C_{2} = 100</m>.
                    So <me>h(t) = -4.9t^{2} + 100</me>.

            Some functions that do not have an obvious antiderivative can be simplified through algebra into a form that is perhaps more helpful.

            <title>A tricky antiderivative</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Find the most general antiderivative of
                    <me>f(x) = \frac{2+x^{2}}{1+x^{2}}.</me>
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    It's tough to think of a function whose derivative is <m>f(x)</m>, though since the denominator is <m>1+x^{2}</m> it seems likely that this antiderivative will involve <m>\tan^{-1}x</m> in some way.
                    In order to actually find the antiderivative, we'll rewrite <m>f(x)</m> into a more convenient form.
                    First, note that the numerator is very close to the denominator, which means we can almost cancel it out.
                    So we'll split up the numerator as follows:
                    <me>\frac{2+x^{2}}{1+x^{2}} = \frac{1+(1+x^{2})}{1+x^{2}} = \frac{1}{1+x^{2}} + 1.</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can find the antiderivative of this term by term, so the most general antiderivative of <m>f(x)</m> is
                    <me>F(x) = \tan^{-1}x + x + C.</me>
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>
        <p>
            At this point, it's natural to think about what an antiderivative means geometrically since the derivative of a function has such a nice interpretation.
            One approach to this is to think about <term>net change</term> of the antiderivative.
            Let <m>F(x)</m> be an antiderivative of <m>f(x)</m> on some interval containing <m>a,b</m>.
            The net change of <m>F(x)</m> from <m>x=a</m> to <m>x=b</m> is given by
            <me>F(b) - F(a).</me>
            Now, <m>F^{\prime}x) = f(x)</m> represents instantaneous rate of change, not net change.
            However, if we can somehow add these instantaneous changes from <m>x=a</m> to <m>x=b</m>, they should accumulate until they give the net change of <m>F</m> from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m>.
            Graphically, adding these instantaneous rates of change looks like it's giving us the <em>area</em> under <m>f(x)</m>, which suggests the following geometric interpretation: <em>the area under of <m>f(x)</m> from <m>x=a</m> to <m>x=b</m> is just the net change of an antiderivative <m>F(x)</m> from <m>x=a</m> to <m>x=b</m>.</em>
            Much of the next chapter is devoted to making this idea precise.
