    <title>Derivatives</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            There are two problems that inspired the creation of calculus.
            The first is the tangent line problem, or rate of change problem.
            This problem is concerned with determining how a quantity <m>f(x)</m> changes as <m>x</m> varies.
            We will focus on this problem and its solution, derivatives, for the next two chapters.
            Afterwards, we will focus on the area problem, the second problem that inspired the creation of calculus.

            <title>Tangent Lines</title>
            <p>
                Consider <m>f(x) = x^{2}</m>.
                If we graph this, we get a parabola.
                What we'd like to do is to find a way to describe how quickly this parabola is changing at a point, i.e. find the "slope" of the parabola.
                One way to try to deal with this is to use <term>secant lines</term>.
                Recall that the secant line through the points <m>(a,f(a))</m> and <m>(b,f(b))</m> has slope <m>\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}</m>, which is just the average rate of change of <m>f</m> from <m>x=a</m> to <m>x=b</m>.
                If <m>b</m> is very close to <m>a</m>, then the slope of the secant line through these points should be a good approximation to the "slope" of <m>f(x) = x^{2}</m> at the point <m>x=a</m>.
            </p>

                    <p>
                        Let <m>f(x) = x^{2}</m>.
                        Find the slope of the secant line through <m>(2,f(2))</m> and <m>(x,f(x))</m>.
                    </p>
                </statement>
                <solution>
                    <p>
                        Since the slope of the secant line is the average rate of change, we get that the slope must be equal to
                        <me>\frac{f(x) - f(2)}{x-2} = \frac{x^{2} - 4}{x-2} = x+2.</me>

                </solution>
            </example>
            <p>
                What <xref ref="example-secant-lines-on-a-parabola" text="type-global" /> is telling us is that if <m>x\approx2</m>, then the slope of <m>f(x) = x^{2}</m> at <m>x=2</m> should be very close to <m>x+2</m>, the slope of the secant line.
                Now we'll do a trick that shows up everywhere in calculus, and is the entire reason we introduced limits in the first place.
                We'll make this approximation exact by taking a limit.
                In particular, we'll say that the slope of <m>f(x) = x^{2}</m> should be equal to
                <me>\lim_{x\to2}\frac{f(x)-f(2)}{x-2} = \lim_{x\to2}(x+2) = 4.</me>
                This is the slope of the <term>tangent line</term> to <m>f(x) = x^{2}</m> at <m>x=2</m>.
                Instead of an average rate of change over an interval <m>[2,x]</m>, we now have an <term>instantaneous rate of change</term> at a point <m>x=2</m>.

                        The slope of the tangent line represents the slope of the graph of <m>f(x)</m> at <m>a</m> and gives the instantaneous rate of change of <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x=a</m>.

                    <p>
                        We need two things to find the equation of a line: the slope of the line and a point on the line.
                        Since we know the tangent line has to pass through <m>(4,2)</m>, we just need to find the slope.
                        The slope is given by
                        <me>\lim_{x\to 4}\frac{\sqrt{x}-2}{x-4} = \lim_{x\to4}\frac{x-4}{(x-4)(\sqrt{x}+2)} = \frac{1}{4}.</me>
                        Hence the equation of the tangent line through <m>(4,2)</m> is

                        The displacement (i.e. position) of a particle moving in a straight line is described by the function <m>s(t) = 3t^{2} - 5t</m>, where <m>t</m> is in seconds and <m>s</m> is in meters.
                        Find the velocity, or instantaneous rate of change, of the particle at <m>t=3</m>.

                <solution>
                    <p>
                        The velocity is just the slope of the tangent line to <m>s(t)</m> at <m>t=3</m>, which we can find as follows:

                        At this step it's a little unclear where to go next, so we'll try long division.
                        If we do so, we get
                        <me>\frac{3t^{2} - 5t - 12}{t-3} = 3t+4.</me>
                        Hence the velocity must be
                        <me>\lim_{t\to3}(3t+4) = 13</me>
                        meters per second.

            <p>
                <xref ref="example-velocity-from-position" text="type-global" /> was a little tricky because we needed to compute <m>\lim_{t\to3}\frac{3t^{2}-5t-12}{t-3}</m>, and it was unclear how to simplify this at first.
                This stemmed in large part from how we computed the velocity in the first place, using the formula
                <me>\lim_{t\to3}\frac{s(t)-s(3)}{t-3}</me>
                or more generally
                <me>\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x-a}</me>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We want to rewrite this formula to make it a little easier to work with in certain cases.
                We'll do this by making the denominator easier to handle.
                In particular, set <m>x-a = h</m>.
                Then
                <me>\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x-a} = \lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.</me>
                Either formula can be used to compute the slope of the tangent line.

            <p>
                We've mentioned before that continuous functions are functions whose graphs can be drawn without lifting your pencil off of the page.
                Likewise, differentiable functions are functions whose graphs can be drawn "smoothly", without any sudden movements or cusps, and without drawing a vertical tangent line.
                If we think about these two concepts, we may suspect that a differentiable function is also continuous.
                If we can draw a graph smoothly, we certainly can't lift our pencil off the page to draw it.
                The next theorem makes this precise.
            </p>
            <theorem xml:id="theorem-differentiable-functions-are-continuous">
                <title>Differentiable Functions Are Continuous</title>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        Let <m>f(x)</m> be a function that is differentiable at <m>x=a</m>.
                        Then <m>f(x)</m> is continuous at <m>x=a</m>.
                    </p>
                </statement>
                <proof>
                    <p>
                        We need to show that <m>\lim_{x\to a}f(x)</m> exists and is equal to <m>f(a)</m>.
                        To do this, we'll start by considering (somewhat counterintuitively) <m>\lim_{x\to a}[f(x)-f(a)]</m>:
                        <md>
                            <mrow>\lim_{x\to a}[f(x)-f(a)] &amp; = \lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}(x-a) </mrow>
                            <mrow> &amp; = \lim_{x\to a}f'(a)(x-a) </mrow>
                            <mrow> &amp; = 0. </mrow>
                        </md>
                        Note that we are using our alternate definition of the derivative here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now we can prove that <m>\lim_{x\to a}f(x) = f(a)</m> as follows:
                        <md>
                            <mrow>\lim_{x\to a}f(x) &amp; = \lim_{x\to a}[f(x) - f(a) + f(a)] </mrow>
                            <mrow> &amp; = \lim_{x\to a}[f(x)-f(a)] + \lim_{x\to a}f(a) </mrow>
                            <mrow> &amp; = 0 + f(a). </mrow>
                        </md>
                        So <m>\lim_{x\to a}f(x) = f(a)</m>, which means that <m>f(x)</m> is continuous at <m>a</m>.
                    </p>
                </proof>
            </theorem>
            <p>
                At this point we might think that a continuous function should also be differentiable, but this is not the case.

                        If we graph <m>f(x)</m> it looks like it shouldn't be differentiable at <m>0</m> because of the cusp.
                        We'll try to prove this mathematically by showing that the limit in <xref ref="definition-the-derivative-function" text="type-global" /> doesn't exist if <m>x=0</m>.
                        First, we'll compute the left hand limit:
                        <me>\lim_{h\to0^{-}}\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h} = \lim_{h\to0^{-}}\frac{-h}{h} = -1.</me>
                        Now, the right hand limit:
                        <me>\lim_{h\to0^{+}}\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h} = \lim_{h\to0^{+}}\frac{h}{h} = 1.</me>
                        Since these limits are different, <m>\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h}</m> does not exist.
                        Hence <m>f</m> is not differentiable at <m>0</m>.

                <p>
                    You may think that a continuous function must at least be differentiable "almost everywhere" at this point.
                    After all, how could it be possible to draw a graph without lifting your pencil off the paper that still has a cusp or a vertical tangent line <em>everywhere</em>?
                    Most mathematicians before the <m>19^{\text{th}}</m> century thought this as well, until Weierstrass came up with a function, the <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weierstrass_function">Weierstrass function</url>, that is continuous everywhere but differentiable <em>nowhere</em>.

                        The position of some particle moving in a line is given by <m>s(t) = 3t-5t^{3}</m>, where <m>t</m> is in seconds and <m>s</m> is in meters.

                    <p>
                        Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, and velocity is the rate of change of position.
                        So we should probably find the velocity first!
                        Let's call it <m>v(t)</m>.
                        We have
                        <md>
                            <mrow>v(t) &amp; = \lim_{h\to0}\frac{s(t+h) - s(t)}{h} </mrow>
                            <mrow> &amp; = \lim_{h\to0}\frac{3(t+h) - 5(t+h)^{3} - 3t + 5t^{3}}{h} </mrow>
                            <mrow> &amp; = \lim_{h\to0}\frac{3h + 5[t^{3} - (t+h)^{3}]}{h} </mrow>
                            <mrow> &amp; = \lim_{h\to0}\frac{3h + 5[(-h)(t^{2} + t(t+h) + (t+h)^{2})]}{h} </mrow>

                        </md>
                        Now we can get the acceleration as well:
                        <me>a(t) = \lim_{h\to0}\frac{v(t+h) - v(t)}{h} = -30t.</me>

            <p>
                In <xref ref="example-acceleration-from-position" text="type-global" />, we had to take two derivatives of the original function <m>s(t)</m> in order to get the acceleration <m>a(t)</m>.
                In other words, <em>acceleration is the second derivative of position</em>.
                So <m>a(t) = \dv{}{t}\dv{s}{t}</m>, which we also write as <m>\dv[2]{s}{t}</m> or <m>s''(t)</m>.
                This is an example of a <term>second-order derivative</term>.
                In general, we have the following definition.

                Although it gets more difficult to assign a physical or geometric significance to higher order derivatives, we can still derive meaning from the second derivative.
                One interpretation of the second derivative is as acceleration, as shown in <xref ref="example-acceleration-from-position" text="type-global" />, and it turns out there's a nice geometric interpretation as well.
                Recall that if <m>f(x)</m> is a function then <m>f'(x)</m> represents the slope, or rate of change, of the graph of <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x</m>.
                Therefore <m>f''(x)</m> represents the rate of change of the slope, i.e. how quickly the slope is increasing or decreasing.
                If <m>f''(x) &gt;0</m> then the slope of <m>f(x)</m> should be increasing, leading to a u-shaped graph.
                Conversely, if <m>f''(x) &lt;0</m> then the slope of <m>f(x)</m> should be decreasing, leading to an upside down u-shaped graph.
                This leads to the following definition.
            </p>

                        Let <m>f(x)</m> be a function with second derivative <m>f''(x)</m>.
                        We say that <m>f(x)</m> is <term>concave up</term> (respectively, <term>concave down</term>) on an interval if <m>f''(x)&gt;0</m> (respectively, <m>f''(x) &lt;0</m>) on that interval.

                So functions that are concave up on an interval tend to be u-shaped on that interval, and functions that are concave down tend to be upside down u-shaped.

                Now we start to find methods that allow us to compute derivatives without going back to <xref ref="definition-the-derivative-function" text="type-global" />.
                Perhaps the easiest rule is the <term>constant rule</term>, which just says that the derivative of a constant is <m>0</m>.

                Our first goal will be to determine a general formula for the derivative of <m>x^{n}</m> for some power <m>n</m>.
                If <m>n\geq0</m> is a whole number, then we can find the derivative of <m>x^{n}</m> without too much trouble.
                In fact, from the <xref ref="definition-the-derivative-function" text="type-global" /> it's not too hard to show that the derivative of <m>x</m> is <m>1</m>, the derivative of <m>x^{2}</m> is <m>2x</m>, the derivative of <m>x^{3}</m> is <m>3x^{2}</m>, and so on.

        <title>The Chain Rule</title>
        <p>
            At this point, we can take derivatives of sums, differences, products and quotients of functions.
            However, these rules aren't very useful for differentiating functions like <m>f(x) = (3x^{2} + \sin x)^{50}</m>.
            We could technically evaluate <m>f'(x)</m> using these rules but it would be an awful way to spend your weekend.
            But if we make the substitution <m>u = 3x^{2} + \sin x</m>, then we can rewrite <m>f(x)</m> as <m>f(u) = u^{50}</m>, which is <em>much</em> easier to differentiate: <m>\dv{f}{u} = 50u^{49}</m>.
            At this step we might be tempted to say that <m>f'(x) = 50u^{49} = 50(3x^{2} + \sin x)^{49}</m>, but this isn't quite right.
            To get the actual derivative we need to consider how the new variable <m>u</m> depends on <m>x</m> as well.
            The <term>Chain Rule</term> is what we need.

                    Now we could try to use the chain rule right here but this would require finding <m>\dv{u}{x}</m>, and <m>u</m> is itself a complicated function of <m>x</m>.

                    We could try to solve for <m>y</m> and then differentiate that to find the slope, but we have a slight problem: it's impossible, at least in terms of "elementary functions".
                    However, we can still use the chain rule to find <m>y'</m>, at least in terms of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
                    We just need to remember that <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>.
                    If we differentiate <m>x^{3} - y^{2} + \sin y = 3</m> with respect to <m>x</m>, we get
                    <me>3x^{2} - 2y\dv{y}{x} + \cos y \dv{y}{x} = 0</me>
                    and so
                    <me>\dv{y}{x} = -\frac{3x^{2}}{\cos y - 2y}.</me>
                    So the slope of the curve at <m>(\sqrt[3]{3},0)</m> is just <m>-3\sqrt[3]{3}^{2}</m>.

                    <me>P'' = \frac{1}{23500}P'(532-P) - \frac{1}{23500}P(P').</me>
                    The current population is about 323.1 million, so we can take <m>P=323.1</m>, which also gives
                    <me>P' = \frac{1}{23500}(323.1)(532-323.1) = 2.9,</me>
                    and so 
                    <me>P'' = \frac{1}{23500}(2.9)(532-323.1) - \frac{1}{23500}(323.1)(2.9) &lt; 0.</me>
                    Hence it appears that the rate of population increase is itself decreasing, which implies that the population growth of the US is slowing down.

                    The radius of a sphere is increasing at a rate of <quantity><mag>4</mag><unit base="meter" prefix="milli"/><per base="second"/></quantity>.
                    How fast is the volume increasing when the radius is <quantity><mag>13</mag><unit base="meter" prefix="milli"/></quantity>?
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    First, let's assign names to all of the changing quantities in this problem:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>V &amp; = \text{volume} </mrow>
                        <mrow>r &amp; = \text{radius} </mrow>
                    </md>
                    Note that we're considering <m>V</m> and <m>r</m> to be functions of time, i.e. <m>V = V(t)</m> and <m>r=r(t)</m>, where <m>t</m> is in seconds.
                    Then we're given that <m>r' = 4</m> and we need to find <m>V'</m> when <m>r=13</m>.
                    To do this, we had better find some relationship between <m>V</m> and <m>r</m>.
                    We can find this by looking at the volume formula for a sphere:
                    <me>V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}.</me>
                    This equation relates <m>r</m> and <m>V</m>, and if we take the derivatives of both sides with respect to time <m>t</m> (using implicit differentiation) then we get an equation relating <m>V'</m> and <m>r'</m>.
                    So let's do that:
                    <me>V' = 4\pi r^{2}r'</me>
                    Now we can plug in our given information to get
                    <me>V' = 4\pi(13^{2})(4) = 2704\pi.</me>
                    So the volume is increasing at a rate of <quantity><mag>2704\pi</mag><unit base="meter" prefix="milli" exp="3"/><per base="second"/></quantity>.
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>
        <p>
            Note that we <em>never</em> found what <m>V(t)</m> and <m>r(t)</m> were in <xref ref="example-changing-volume-on-a-sphere" text="type-global" />, but we didn't need to.
            All we needed to find was a relationship between the two changing quantities, i.e. the two derivatives, to answer the question.

            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    We have a <em>lot</em> of information to process here, so we'll take things a step at a time.
                    The changing quantities are
                    <md>
                        <mrow>h(t) &amp; = \text{height of water} </mrow>
                        <mrow>r(t) &amp; = \text{radius of water} </mrow>
                        <mrow>V(t) &amp; = \text{volume of water} </mrow>
                    </md>
                    where <m>t</m> is in minutes.
                    We need to find the rate at which water is entering the tank, so let's call this mystery number <m>C</m>.
                    Then all we know about <m>C</m> is that it's related to the rate that the volume is changing.
                    In particular, we should have <m>V' = C - 10000</m>.
                    So to find <m>C</m> we need to find <m>V'</m>, which means we need to set up a relationship between <m>V</m> and the other changing quantities to determine how exactly <m>V</m> is changing, using the fact that <m>h' = 20</m> when <m>h=200</m> (after converting to centimeters).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the fact that the water is in a conical tank, we can use the formula for the volume of a cone to say that <m>V = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^{2}h</m>.
                    If we differentiate both sides with respect to <m>t</m>, then we get
                    <me>V' = \frac{1}{3}\pi (2rr'h + r^{2}h').</me>
                    Unfortunately, we don't have any information on <m>r</m> or <m>r'</m> that we can use, just information on <m>h</m> and <m>h'</m>.
                    So we need to get <m>r</m> in terms of <m>h</m>.
                    By similar triangles, we can say that <m>\frac{r}{h} = \frac{200}{600} = \frac{1}{3}</m>, and so <m>r = \frac{h}{3}</m> and likewise <m>r' = \frac{h'}{3}</m>.
                    Hence
                    <me>V' = \frac{1}{3}\pi (2rr'h + r^{2}h') = \frac{1}{3}\pi \left(2\frac{h^{2}h'}{9} + \frac{h^{2}h'}{9}\right)</me>
                    which boils down to
                    <me>V' = \frac{h^{2}h'}{9}\pi = \frac{800000\pi}{9}.</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, <em>finally</em>, we can answer the original question.
                    The rate that water is flowing into the tank is
                    <me>C = V' + 10000 = \frac{800000\pi}{9} + 10000,</me>
                    or just <quantity><mag>289252.68</mag><unit base="meter" prefix="centi" exp="3"/><per base="minute"/></quantity>.
                    In terms of meters this is <quantity><mag>.29</mag><unit base="meter" exp="3"/><per base="minute"/></quantity>, which perhaps looks a bit more reasonable.

            Suppose we graph the tangent line to <m>y=\sqrt{x}</m> at <m>x=4</m>.
            The equation of this line will be

            If we look at the tangent line next to the graph, we'll see that the line is very close to the graph of <m>y=\sqrt{x}</m> if <m>x</m> is very close to <m>4</m>.
            So we can use the equation of the tangent line to approximate <m>y=\sqrt{x}</m> when <m>x</m> is near <m>4</m>.
