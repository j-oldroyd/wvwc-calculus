    <title>Partial Derivatives</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            For functions that depend on a single independent variable
            such as <m>x</m> or <m>t</m>, derivatives are useful
            because they represent how the function itself changes as
            the independent variable changes.  However, there are many
            situations where it makes sense to consider functions of
            more than one independent variable.  Therefore, we will
            want to extend the notion of derivative to include these
            functions as well.  Our primary tool for this will be the
            <term>partial derivative</term>, which we'll see in <xref
            ref="section-partial-derivatives" text="type-global" />.
            But we'll need to build up some terminology to get there.

                A function of several variables is a function that
                depends on more than one independent variable.  One
                such example comes from differential equations, where
                quantities such as the temperature of a metal rod
                depend on both a position <m>x</m> and a time
                <m>t</m>.

                        A <term>function of two variables</term> is a rule <m>f</m> or <m>z = f(x,y)</m> that assigns pairs <m>(x,y)</m> of real numbers to real numbers.
                        The <term>domain</term> is the set <m>D</m> in <m>\RR^{2}</m> for which the rule is defined.
                        The <term>range</term> is the set <m>R</m> in <m>\RR</m> of all possible values of <m>f</m>.
                        <m>x,y</m> are called independent variables and <m>z</m> is called the <term>dependent variable</term>.

                        Let <m>f(x,y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}}}</m>.

                    <p>
                        We'll break this down into pieces.
                        First, since we're dealing with square roots in real numbers we need <m>x^{2}+y^{2}\leq4</m>.
                        Second, we need to make sure that <m>\sqrt{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}}\neq0</m>.
                        So the domain of <m>f</m> is the set of all points <m>(x,y)</m> in <m>\RR^{2}</m> such that <m>x^{2} + y^{2} &lt; 4</m>.
                        In other words, the domain is just the inside of the circle of radius <m>2</m> centered at the origin.
                    </p>
                </solution>
            </example>
            <p>
                We can also graph functions of two variables by viewing <m>f(x,y)</m> as representing the height of some surface over the point <m>(x,y)</m> in the <m>xy</m>-plane.
                In other words, just as <m>y = f(x)</m> represents a curve in <m>\RR^{2}</m>, the equation <m>z = f(x,y)</m> represents a surface in <m>\RR^{3}</m>.

                        Sketch the surface given by <m>f(x,y) = \sqrt{4x^{2} + y^{2}}</m>.
                    </p>

                <solution>
                    <p>
                        We need to sketch <m>z = \sqrt{4x^{2} + y^{2}}</m>.
                        We can start by squaring both sides to get <m>z^{2} = 4x^{2} + y^{2}</m>.
                        If we look at the right hand side, it looks a lot like an ellipse, so we'll try to work with that.
                        Assuming <m>z\neq0</m>, we can rewrite the equation to get
                        <me>\frac{x^{2}}{z^{2}/4} + \frac{y^{2}}{z^{2}} = 1</me>
                        For any given positive value of <m>z</m>, this represents an ellipse that extends to <m>\frac{z}{2}</m> in the <m>x</m> direction and <m>z</m> in the <m>y</m> direction.
                        So as <m>z</m> increases, these ellipses increase in size as well.

                        If we pick different (nonnegative) values for <m>k</m>, then all of the contours of <m>f(x,y)</m> take the form

        <title>Limits and Continuity</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>
                In this section we begin extending calculus concepts from one dimension to higher dimensions, starting with limits.

        <subsection xml:id="subsection-limits">
            <title>Limits</title>
            <p>
                Just as functions of one variable have a notion of limit, the same can be said for functions of several variables.
                However, limits involving several variables tend to be more restrictive.
            </p>

                <title>Limit of a Function of Two Variables</title>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        Let <m>f(x,y)</m> be some function and let <m>(a,b)</m> be a point arbitrarily close to the domain of <m>f</m>.
                        We say that
                        <me>\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}f(x,y) = L</me>
                        if <m>f(x,y)</m> gets arbitrarily close to <m>L</m> as <m>(x,y)</m> gets arbitrarily close to <m>(a,b)</m>.
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </definition>
            <p>
                Here's why limits can be tricky in two dimensions: for the limit to exist, <m>f(x,y)</m> must approach the same value <m>L</m> no matter how <m>(x,y)</m> approaches <m>(a,b)</m>!
            </p>
            <example>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        Find
                        <me>\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}\frac{x^{2}\sin y}{x^{3}+2y^{3}}</me>
                        or show that it doesn't exist.
                    </p>
                </statement>
                <solution>
                    <p>
                        First, we'll start simple.
                        If we set <m>x = 0</m> then the limit becomes
                        <me>\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}\frac{x^{2}\sin y}{x^{3}+2y^{3}} = \lim_{y\to0}\frac{0}{2y} = 0.</me>
                        Likewise, if we set <m>y=0</m> then the limit becomes
                        <me>\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}\frac{x^{2}\sin y}{x^{3}+2y^{3}} = \lim_{x\to0}\frac{0}{x^{3}} = 0.</me>
                        From this, we might suspect that the limit actually exists.
                        However, we need to make sure that this approaches <m>0</m> along <em>all possible paths</em> to <m>(0,0)</m>.
                        Here's another path we can try: <m>y = x</m>.
                        If we do this, then the limit becomes
                        <me>\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}\frac{x^{2}\sin y}{x^{3}+2y^{3}} = \lim_{x\to0}\frac{x^{2}\sin x}{3x^{3}} = \frac{1}{3}.</me>
                        Since the value that <m>\frac{x^{2}\sin y}{x^{3}+2y^{3}}</m> approaches as <m>(x,y)\to(0,0)</m> depends on how <m>(x,y)</m> approaches <m>(0,0)</m>, we can say that the limit does not exist.
                    </p>
                </solution>
            </example>
            <p>
                In general, showing limits exist for functions of several variables can be tricky.
                However, occasionally we can use some tricks to make these problems more manageable.
            </p>
            <example xml:id="example-showing-a-limit-exists">
                <title>Showing a limit exists</title>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        Find <m>\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}(x^{2}+y^{2})\ln(x^{2}+y^{2})</m>.
                    </p>
                </statement>
                <solution>
                    <p>
                        Since the inside of the limit depends on <m>x^{2}+y^{2}</m>, this suggests that switching to polar coordinates might be beneficial.
                        So let's try that!
                        <me>\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}(x^{2}+y^{2})\ln(x^{2}+y^{2}) = \lim_{(r,\theta)\to(0,0)}r^{2}\ln r^{2}.</me>
                        Here's why this helps us.
                        If we look at our new limit, we see that it doesn't depend on <m>\theta</m> at all.
                        In other words, <em>it doesn't depend on the direction</em> we approach the origin from, just the distance from the origin <m>r</m>.
                        So
                        <md>
                            <mrow>\lim_{(r,\theta)\to(0,0)}r^{2}\ln r^{2} &amp; = \lim_{r\to0^{+}} 2r^{3}\ln r </mrow>
                            <mrow> &amp; = 0 </mrow>
                        </md>
                        and so the original limit also equals <m>0</m>.
                    </p>
                </solution>

                        We say that <m>f</m> is <term>continuous</term> at <m>(a,b)</m> if

                We won't typically use the definition of continuity in this course.
                We'll just make of several common types of continuous functions:

                <li>Compositions of the form <m>g(f(x,y))</m>, where <m>g(x)</m> and <m>f(x,y)</m> are continuous, are continuous wherever they are defined.</li>

            Now that we know how to take limits for functions of two variables, we can define a notion of derivative for these functions as well, which we'll call the <term>partial derivative</term>.
            The main idea behind the partial derivative is to measure how a function <m>f(x,y)</m> changes as a single variable changes.
            Although the definition given is only for functions of two variables, it also extends to functions of many variables.

            <statement>
                <p>
                    Let <m>f(x,y)</m> be a function of two variables.
                    The <term>partial derivative of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>x</m></term> is the function
                    <me>\pdv{f}{x} = f_{x}(x,y) = \lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x+h,y)-f(x,y)}{h}</me>,
                    assuming that this limit exists.
                    Similarly, the <term>partial derivative of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>y</m></term> is the function
                    <me>\pdv{f}{y} = f_{y}(x,y) = \lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x,y+h)-f(x,y)}{h}</me>,
                    assuming that this limit exists.

            </statement>
        </definition>
        <p>
            When computing partial derivatives with respect to <m>x</m>, you just need to differentiate <m>f(x,y)</m> treating it as a function of <m>x</m> alone and considering <m>y</m> as a constant.
            Similarly, if you want to compute <m>f_{y}</m> you differentiate with respect to <m>y</m> and treat <m>x</m> as constant.

                    Since we need to find <m>\pdv{f}{y}</m>, we differentiate <m>f(x,y)</m> with respect to <m>y</m> and treat <m>x</m> as a constant:

        <p>
            Geometrically, <m>f_{x}(a,b)</m> represents the rate of change of the surface <m>z = f(x,y)</m> at the point <m>(a,b)</m> in the <m>x</m> direction, and a similar statement is true for <m>f_{y}(a,b)</m>.

                    Let <m>z = \sqrt{1-x^{2} - y^{2}}</m>.

                <p>
                    We can find this algebraically, but we'll try to answer this geometrically instead.
                    First, note that <m>z = \sqrt{1 - x^{2} - y^{2}}</m> is actually the top half of the unit sphere.
                    If we're trying to find where <m>\pdv{z}{y}</m> is zero, then we need to find where this surface is "flat" when moving in the <m>y</m> direction.
                    If we think about this a bit, this should only occur when <m>y=0</m>, i.e. along the <m>x</m>-axis.
                    At any other location on the unit sphere, moving in the <m>y</m>-direction on the unit sphere requires going uphill or downhill, which means <m>z_{y}\neq0</m> at these locations.

            We can also find higher partial derivatives.
            For example, the second partial derivatives of a function <m>f(x,y)</m> are given by

        <title>Tangent Planes and Linear Approximations</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>
                In Calculus I, derivatives are used to find linear approximations to functions of the form <m>f(x)</m>.
                We can use partial derivatives to do the same for functions with several independent variables.
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <subsection xml:id="subsection-tangent-planes">
            <title>Tangent Planes</title>
            <p>
                Recall that if a curve <m>y=f(x)</m> is differentiable at a point <m>x_{0}</m>, then it has a tangent line passing through <m>(x_{0},f(x_{0})).</m>
                The tangent line can be viewed as a linear approximation of the curve <m>y=f(x)</m> near the point <m>x_{0}</m>.
                We can apply a similar ideas to surfaces <m>z = f(x,y)</m>.
                It turns out that if we have a surface <m>z = f(x,y)</m> and a point <m>(x_{0},y_{0}, f(x_{0},y_{0}))</m> on the surface, then every tangent vector at this point is contained in a single plane called the <term>tangent plane</term>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We'd like to find the equation of this plane.
                First, recall that every plane can be described by an equation of the form
                <me>a(x-x_{0})+b(y-y_{0})+c(z-z_{0}) = 0.</me>
                We can view <m>x_{0},y_{0}</m> and <m>z_{0} = f(x_{0},y_{0})</m> as given, so we just need to find <m>a,b,c</m>.
                If we assume that <m>c\neq 0</m>, then we can rewrite this equation to obtain
                <me>z-z_{0} = A(x-x_{0}) + B(y-y_{0})</me>
                where <m>A = -\frac{a}{c}</m> and <m>B = -\frac{b}{c}</m>.
                If we set <m>y=y_{0}</m>, then we have <m>z-z_{0} = A(x-x_{0})</m>.
                This is the equation of a line tangent to the surface and parallel to the <m>x</m>-axis, and so the slope of this line must be
                <me>A = f_{x}(x_{0},y_{0})</me>
                since the slope of a tangent line in the <m>x</m>-direction gives the rate of change in the <m>x</m>-direction.
                Similarly,
                <me>B = f_{y}(x_{0},y_{0}).</me>
                Putting all of this together gives the following theorem.

        <title>The Chain Rule in Several Variables</title>
        <p>
            Recall that from Calc I, we know that
            <me>\dv{}{x}f(g(x)) = \dv{f}{g}\dv{g}{x} = f'(g(x))g'(x).</me>
            This is just the the chain rule, which tells us how to differentiate functions that depend on other functions.
            Or to think of it another way, it tells us how to differentiate <em>variables</em> like <m>f</m> that depend on other variables like <m>g</m> and <m>x</m>.
            What we'd like to do now is to extend the chain rule to more complicated situations.
            We'll start with the following formula.

        <title>Directional Derivatives and Gradients</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>
                For a differentiable function <m>f(x,y)</m>, the partial derivatives <m>f_{x}</m> and <m>f_{y}</m> give the rates of change of <m>f</m> in the directions of the <m>x</m>-axis and <m>y</m>-axis, respectively.
                To put this another way, <m>f_{x}</m> gives the rate of change of <m>f</m> in the direction of the vector <m>\vb{i}</m>, and <m>f_{y}</m> gives the rate of change in the direction of the vector <m>\vb{j}</m>.
                But we have infinitely many directions to work with.
                How can we find the rate of change of <m>f</m> in <em>any</em> direction?
                We'll look at two tools to help us with this: directional derivatives and gradients.

        <subsection xml:id="subsection-the-directional-derivative">
            <title>The Directional Derivative</title>
            <p>
                Suppose we have a function <m>f(x,y)</m> defined at a point <m>(x_{0},y_{0})</m>.
                We want to find how quickly <m>f(x,y)</m> is changing in the direction of some unit vector <m>\vb{u} = \dotprod{a,b}</m>.
                We can estimate this by moving from the point <m>(x_{0},y_{0})</m> by some small increment <m>h\vb{u}</m>, and evaluating <m>f</m> at this new point, which is just <m>(x_{0} + ha, y_{0} + hb)</m>.
                So the approximate rate of change in <m>f</m> in the direction of <m>\vb{u}</m> is given by
                <me>\frac{f(x_{0}+ha, y_{0} + hb) - f(x_{0},y_{0})}{h}</me>
                As <m>h\to0</m>, this should become exact.
                This leads us to our next definition.

                        assuming this limit exists.
                        As we mentioned above, <m>D_{\vb{i}}f = f_{x}</m> and <m>D_{\vb{j}}f = f_{y}</m>.

                        <me>D_{\vb{u}}f(x,y) = f_{x}(x,y)a + f_{y}(x,y)b.</me>
                    </p>
                </statement>
                <proof>
                    <p>
                        First, set
                        <me>g(h) = f(x_{0}+ha, y_{0} +hb)</me>
                        Then by the Calculus I definition of the derivative,
                        <me>g'(0) = \lim_{h\to0}\frac{g(h) - g(0)}{h} = \lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x_{0}+ha, y_{0}+hb) - f(x_{0},y_{0})}{h} = D_{\vb{u}}f(x_{0},y_{0}).</me>
                        On the other hand, if we set <m>x = x_{0} + ha</m> and <m>y = y_{0} + hb</m>, then <m>g(h) = f(x,y)</m>.
                        We can then find <m>g'(h)</m> using the chain rule from <xref ref="section-the-chain-rule" text="type-global" /> to get

                        We have <m>f(x,y) = xe^{-x^{2} - y^{2}}</m>, and the critical points are <m>(-\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}},0)</m> and <m>(\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}},0)</m>.
                        We need to find <m>D(x,y)</m>.
                        Since <m>f_{x} = (1 - 2x^{2})e^{-x^{2} - y^{2}}</m>, we get

                        So this is a local minimum.
                        At <m>(\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}},0)</m>, we still have <m>D&gt;0</m>, but now <m>f_{xx}&lt;0</m>.

                Even if a function <m>f(x,y)</m> has a local minimum at <m>(x_{0},y_{0})</m>, there's no guarantee that this is the smallest value the function can take on its domain.
                A similar statement is also true for local maxima, which leads to the following definition.

                            We call the point <m>(x_{0},y_{0})</m> an <term>absolute minimum</term> (respectively, <term>absolute maximum</term>) if <m>f(x,y)\geq f(x_{0},y_{0})</m> (respectively, <m>f(x,y)\leq f(x_{0},y_{0})</m>) for all points <m>(x,y)</m> in <m>R</m>.

                As a first example, consider <m>f(x,y) = \sqrt{1 - x^{2} - y^{2}}</m>, which gives the top half of the unit sphere.
                Using critical points and the second derivative test, we can show that the origin is a local maximum.
                However, this method is blind to the absolute minimum values of <m>f(x,y)</m>, which occur at the boundary <m>x^{2} + y^{2} = 1</m>, where the sphere intersects the <m>xy</m>-plane.
                So this means we can't use critical points alone to find absolute maxima and minima, in general.
                However, the following theorem says that they'll get us most of the way there.

                    <p>
                        We'll start off by finding any critical points.
                        Since <m>\grad f = \dotprod{1-y, 1-x}</m>, we see that the only critical point is <m>(1,1)</m>.
                        Now we need to see what happens to <m>f(x,y)</m> on the edges of the triangle, and to do that we need to find equations for the edges.
                        Let <m>l_{1}</m> denote the edge from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(0,2)</m>, <m>l_{2}</m> the edge from <m>(0,2)</m> to <m>(4,0)</m> and <m>l_{3}</m> the edge from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(4,0)</m>.
                        Then <m>l_{1}</m> is given by the equation <m>x = 0</m>, <m>l_{2}</m> is given by <m>y = -\frac{1}{2}(x-4)</m> and <m>l_{3}</m> is given by <m>y = 0</m>.
                        So on <m>l_{1}</m> we have <m>f(x,y) = f(0,y) = y</m>, on <m>l_{2}</m> we have

                        and on <m>l_{3}</m> we have <m>f(x,y) = f(x,0) = x</m>.

                        Finally, at the critical point <m>(1,1)</m> we have <m>f(1,1) = 1</m>.
                        So putting this all together, we can say that the absolute maximum of <m>f(x,y)</m> on this triangle is <m>4</m>, and this is reached at <m>(4,0)</m>.
                        Similarly, the absolute minimum is <m>0</m>, and this is reached at the origin.

                        First we'll find the critical point(s).
                        If we compute <m>\grad f</m>, we get <m>\grad f = \dotprod{y^{2}, 2xy}</m>.
                        This is <m>0</m> if and only if <m>y=0</m>, and if <m>y=0</m> then this forces <m>f(x,y) = f(x,0) = 0</m>.

                    <p>
                        Now we need to determine the maximum and minimum values of <m>f(x,y)</m> on the boundary of <m>D</m>.

        <title>Lagrange Multipliers</title>
        <p>
            <xref ref="theorem-second-derivative-test" text="type-global" /> is useful for finding local maxima and minima of a function <m>f(x,y)</m>, but it's often the case where we have an additional restriction on the variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, which we interpret as an equality <m>g(x,y) = k</m> for some constant <m>k</m>.
            Geometrically, this reduces down to finding the maximum and minimum values of <m>f(x,y)</m> on the curve <m>g(x,y) = k</m>.
            This problem can be attacked algebraically using contours, as in the example below.

              Estimate the minimum and maximum values of <m>f(x,y) = x^2 + 2y^2</m> subject to the constraint <m>g(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 = 1</m>.

          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              The constraint is represented as a contour plot of <m>g(x,y)</m>.
              We can compare this with contours of <m>f(x,y)</m>, and any point where there two contours intersect is a point for which the constraint is satisfied.

              </figure>
              <p>
                Using these contours, we see that the maximum value of <m>f</m> subject to <m>g = 1</m> appears to be <m>2</m>, while the minimum value of <m>f</m> subject to <m>g=1</m> appears to be <m>1</m>.
              </p>

        <p>
            Although the graphical approach used in <xref ref="example-constrained-optimization-using-contours" text="type-global" /> and specifically in <xref ref="figure-lagrange-contour-example" text="type-global" /> is useful for estimating solutions of constrained optimization problems in two dimensions, it's neither exact nor easy to visualize in higher dimensions.
            We therefore want to determine an algebraic approach for solving these problems.
            In these cases, <xref ref="theorem-second-derivative-test" text="type-global" /> is not as useful because there's no guarantee that the critical points of <m>f</m> will lie on the curve <m>g(x,y) = k</m>.
            For this scenario, we must use the method of <term>Lagrange multipliers</term>.

                    What dimensions give the maximum volume?
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    If we denote the dimensions of the box by <m>x,y,z</m>, then the function we need to maximize is <m>V(x,y,z) = xyz</m>.
                    However, not all dimensions are valid since we're only allowed to use <quantity><mag>12</mag><unit base="meter" exp="2" /></quantity> of material.
                    This means that the surface area of the box, which is given by <m>A(x,y,z) = xy + 2xz + 2yz</m>, must be equal to <m>12</m>.
                    So our constraint is that <m>A(x,y,z) = 12</m>, and because we have this constraint we'll try to solve this using <xref ref="algorithm-method-of-lagrange-multipliers" text="type-global" />.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To begin, we need to solve <m>\grad V = \lambda \grad A</m>.
                    Equivalently, we need to solve the system
                    <md>
                        <mrow>V_{x} &amp; = \lambda A_{x} </mrow>
                        <mrow>V_{y} &amp; = \lambda A_{y} </mrow>
                        <mrow>V_{z} &amp; = \lambda A_{z} </mrow>
                    </md>
                    which turns into
                    <md>
                        <mrow>yz &amp; = \lambda(y + 2z) </mrow>
                        <mrow>xz &amp; = \lambda(x + 2z) </mrow>
                        <mrow>xy &amp; = \lambda(2x + 2y) </mrow>
                    </md>
                    Now, we don't actually need to find a value for <m>\lambda</m>.
                    We just need values for <m>x,y,z</m>.
                    If we multiply these equations by <m>x</m>, <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> respectively, then we get
                    <md>
                        <mrow>xyz &amp; = \lambda(xy + 2xz) </mrow>
                        <mrow>xyz &amp; = \lambda(xy + 2yz) </mrow>
                        <mrow>xyz &amp; = \lambda(2xz + 2yz) </mrow>
                    </md>
                    or just
                    <me>\lambda(xy + 2xz) = \lambda(xy + 2yz) = \lambda(2xz + 2yz)</me>
                    We can also divide by <m>\lambda</m>, since there's no way <m>\lambda</m> could equal <m>0</m> and satisfy the above equations (since <m>x,y,z</m> are all positive).
                    This gives us
                    <men xml:id="equation-lagrange-example-1">xy + 2xz = xy + 2yz = 2xz + 2yz</men>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first two expressions in <xref ref="equation-lagrange-example-1" text="type-global" /> simplify to <m>x=y</m>, while the first and third reduce to <m>x = 2z</m>.
                    So
                    <me>x = y = 2z</me>.
                    But these variables also need to satisfy <m>A(x,y,z) = 12</m>:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>12 &amp; = xy + 2xz + 2yz </mrow>
                        <mrow> &amp; = 4z^{2} + 4z^{2} + 4z^{2} </mrow>
                        <mrow> &amp; = 12z^{2} </mrow>
                    </md>
                    Therefore <m>z = \pm1</m>, so we take <m>z=1</m> (since we're dealing with dimensions).
                    This also means that <m>x = y = 2(1) = 2</m>.
                    So the point <m>(2,2,1)</m> is therefore our candidate for the dimensions that maximize volume subject to the constraint <m>A = 12</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to actually verify that <m>V(2,2,1) = 4</m> is actually the largest possible volume we can obtain, we need to show that it's actually a maximum and not a minimum.
                    This means we need to find another point <m>(x,y,z)</m> that also satisfies <m>A = 12</m>, and show that it gives a smaller value for <m>V</m>.
                    One such point is just <m>(-2,-2,-1)</m>, and <m>V(-2,-2,-1) = -4 &lt; V(2,2,1)</m>.
                    So <m>4</m> is actually a maximum value and not a minimum value.
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>
        <p>
            The points we'll obtain using Lagrange multipliers will be either maxima or minima, but the method itself doesn't always tell us which is which.
            As in the last example, sometimes it's up to us to find that on our own.

            <title>Extreme values on a paraboloid</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Find the absolute maxima and minima for <m>f(x,y) = x^{2} + 2y^{2}</m> over this disk <m>x^{2} + y^{2} \leq 1</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    First, recall from <xref ref="section-extreme-values" text="type-global" /> that the absolute maxima and minima of a differentiable function over a bounded set occur at either a critical point or somewhere on the boundary.
                    So first, we need to find if <m>f(x,y)</m> has any critical points inside the disk.
                    If we solve <m>f_{x} = f_{y} = 0</m>, then we quickly get that <m>(0,0)</m> is a critical point, and hence a possible maximum or minimum value.
                    The only other place we need to check is the boundary <m>x^{2} + y^{2} = 1</m>, and this is something we can use Lagrange multipliers for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Set <m>g(x,y) = x^{2} + y^{2}</m>.
                    Then we need to find the extreme values of <m>f</m> subject to the constraint <m>g = 1</m>.
                    The system of equations we need to solve is then
                    <md>
                        <mrow>2x &amp; = \lambda(2x) &amp; \Rightarrow x = \lambda x </mrow>
                        <mrow>4y &amp; = \lambda(2y) &amp; \Rightarrow 2y = \lambda y</mrow>
                        <mrow>x^{2} + y^{2} &amp; = 1 </mrow>
                    </md>
                    The first equation is true if <m>\lambda = 1</m>, but then this forces <m>y = 0</m> in the second equation.
                    If we then plug <m>y = 0</m> into the constraint, this forces <m>x = \pm1</m>.
                    So the case <m>\lambda=1</m> gives us two points to test: <m>(-1,0)</m> and <m>(1,0)</m>.
                    On the other hand, the second equation is true if <m>\lambda = 2</m>.
                    This then forces <m>x = 0</m> and <m>y = \pm 1</m>, which gives us the points <m>(0,-1)</m> and <m>(0,1)</m>.
                    Finally, if <m>\lambda\neq1,2</m>, then this forces <m>x = y = 0</m>.
                    But there's no way to satisfy the constraint if <m>x = y = 0</m>, so we discard this possibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we have five points that we need to check, which we arrange in the following table:

                    So the absolute minimum is <m>0</m>, which occurs at the origin.
                    The absolute maximum is <m>2</m>, which occurs at the points <m>(0,\pm1)</m>.

            <title>Maximizing the volume of a prism within an ellipsoid</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    A rectangular prism, centered at the origin and with sides parallel to the coordinate planes, is inscribed within the ellipsoid <m>x^{2} + \frac{y^{2}}{4} + \frac{z^{2}}{4} = 1</m>.
                    Find the dimensions of the prism that maximize the volume.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    Let <m>(x,y,z)</m> denote the corner of the prism located in the first octant.
                    Then we want to maximize <m>V(x,y,z) = (2x)(2y)(2z)</m> subject to the constraint <m>g(x,y,z) = x^{2} + \frac{y^{2}}{4} + \frac{z^{2}}{4} = 1</m>.
                    So we'll use the method of Lagrange multipliers again to get the system
                    <md>
                        <mrow>8yz &amp; = 2\lambda x </mrow>
                        <mrow>8xz &amp; = \frac{\lambda}{2}y </mrow>
                        <mrow>8xy &amp; = \frac{\lambda}{2}z </mrow>
                        <mrow>x^{2} + \frac{y^{2}}{4} + \frac{z^{2}}{4} &amp; =1 </mrow>
                    </md>
                    We can assume that <m>x,y,z</m> are all positive (since we're trying to find the <em>maximum</em> volume), so we can go ahead and solve each equation for <m>\lambda</m> to get
                    <me>\lambda = \frac{4yz}{x} = \frac{16xz}{y} = \frac{16xy}{z}</me>
                    Setting the first two fractions equal and simplifying gives <m>y^{2} = 4x^{2}</m>.
                    Similarly, the second and third fractions give <m>y^{2} = z^{2}</m>.
                    So
                    <me>y^{2} = z^{2} = 4x^{2}.</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now we plug this into our constraint to get
                    <md>
                        <mrow>1 &amp; = x^{2} + \frac{y^{2}}{4} + \frac{z^{2}}{4} = 1 </mrow>
                        <mrow> &amp; = 3x^{2} </mrow>
                    </md>
                    so <m>x = \pm\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}</m>.
                    Since we're assuming that <m>(x,y,z)</m> lies in the first octant, this means that <m>x &gt; 0</m>, along with <m>y </m>and <m>z</m>.
                    So
                    <md>
                        <mrow>x &amp; = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} </mrow>

                    </md>
                    To check that these values actually maximize <m>V(x,y,z)</m>, we can compare them with the point <m>(1,0,0)</m>, which also satisfies the constraint <m>g = 1</m>.
                    Since <m>V(1,0,0) = 0</m>, this means that the dimensions that maximize the volume are given by
                    <me>\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\times\frac{4}{\sqrt{3}}\times\frac{4}{\sqrt{3}}</me>
