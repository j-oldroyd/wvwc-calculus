    <title>Limits of Functions</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            At its heart, calculus is just the mathematics of change.
            In particular, calculus provides the tools necessary to describe how a function changes.
            Since a function can be used to represent many quantities that appear in real life, calculus therefore gives us a way to study how many different quantities (such as temperature, acceleration, energy of a signal, etc.) can change.
            But before we can start using calculus, we need to come up with the proper language to describe it.
            The language we will need to develop is that of the <em>limit of a function</em>.

                Imagine creating a mathematical valley out of the graph of <m>f(x) = x^{2}</m>, and in this valley walks a mathematical ant.
                The ant is walking towards the place on the hill directly above <m>x = -\frac{1}{2}</m>.
                At <m>x=-2</m>, the ant is <m>4</m> units above the ground.
                At <m>x=-1</m>, the ant is now <m>1</m> unit above the ground.
                As the ant moves towards <m>x=-\frac{1}{2}</m>, its height above the ground gets closer and closer to <m>\frac{1}{4}</m>.
                To say it more clearly, and because modern calculus is built on this idea, <em>as the ant approaches</em> the point above <m>x = -\frac{1}{2}</m>, its <em>height above the ground approaches</em> the value <m>\frac{1}{4}</m>.
                In other words, the <em>limit</em> of <m>f(x) = x^{2}</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>-\frac{1}{2}</m> is <m>\frac{1}{4}</m>.

                Remember that a function <m>f</m> of the variable <m>x</m> is just a rule that turns one number, <m>x</m>, into another number, <m>f(x)</m>.
                So the idea that the <em>limit of a function</em> is trying to express is what happens to the number <m>f(x)</m> (the output) as the number <m>x</m> (the input) approaches some particular value.

                <p>
                    Actually, functions are much more general than this.
                    But for calculus, it won't hurt us to view functions in this way.

            </aside>
            <p>
                We're not quite ready to define the limit of a function precisely, but we can point one thing out right away: <em>the limit of a function requires two pieces of information: the function itself and the number that <m>x</m> is approaching.</em>
                The limit should then be whatever number that <m>f(x)</m> is approaching.

                        We don't have a lot of tools to find limits yet, so we'll try to estimate it instead.
                        What we'll do is we'll plug numbers that are closer and closer to <m>\pi</m> into <m>f(x)</m>.
                        Let's list several values of <m>f(x)</m> as <m>x</m> gets closer to <m>\pi</m> from the left:

                        We can even let <m>x</m> approach <m>\pi</m> from the other direction as well (i.e. "from the right") and <m>f(x)</m> will still approach <m>0</m> as <m>x</m> gets closer and closer to <m>\pi</m>.
                        So it looks like the limit should be <m>0</m>.

                To keep ourselves from writing "the limit of <m>f(x)</m> as <m>x</m> approaches some number <m>a</m>" over and over, let's introduce some notation: <m>\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)</m>.

                        Let
                    </p>
                    <me>f(x) = \begin{cases} \sin x &amp; \text{if $x&lt;0$} \\ \cos x &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}.</me>
                    <p>
                        Find <m>\lim\limits_{x\to0}f(x)</m>.

                    <p>
                        If we graph this function, we see that at <m>x=0</m> there is a jump in the graph.
                        In particular, if <m>x</m> approaches <m>0</m> from the left then <m>f(x)</m> approaches <m>0</m>, whereas if <m>x</m> approaches <m>0</m> from the right then <m>f(x)</m> approaches <m>1</m>.
                        So this function does not appear to have an unambiguous limit as <m>x</m> approaches <m>0</m>.
                        Another way to say this: <m>\lim\limits_{x\to0}f(x)</m> <em>does not exist</em>.
                    </p>
                </solution>

            <p>
                <xref ref="example-limit-of-a-piecewise-function" text="type-global" /> shows us something very important about limits: they depend on the two different ways <m>x</m> can approach a number.
                So we introduce two new pieces of notation: the <term>left-hand limit</term> <m>\lim_{x\to a^{-}}f(x)</m> will stand for the value <m>f(x)</m> approaches (if any) as <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m> from the left (i.e. as <m>x</m> increases to <m>a</m>), and <term>the right-hand limit</term> <m>\lim_{x\to a^{+}}f(x)</m> will stand for the value <m>f(x)</m> approaches (if any) as <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m> from the right (i.e. as <m>x</m> decreases to <m>a</m>).
                In <xref ref="example-limit-of-a-piecewise-function" text="type-global" />, we would say that
                <me>\lim_{x\to0^{-}}f(x) = 0\text{ and }\lim_{x\to0^{+}}f(x) = 1</me>.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this point, we can make a rough definition for the limit of a function.

                        The graph shows us that <m>\lim_{x\to-1^{-}}f(x) = 0</m>, while <m>\lim_{x\to-1^{+}}f(x) = 1</m>.
                        Therefore <m>\lim_{x\to-1}f(x)</m> does not exist.
                        On the other hand, <m>\lim_{x\to\frac{1}{2}}f(x)</m> exists and is equal to <m>\frac{1}{4}</m>.

                It's important to note that the value of a function at a point <m>x=a</m> is in general <em>completely independent</em> of the value of <m>\lim_{x\to a}f(x)</m>, i.e., we can't always expect <m>\lim_{x\to a}f(x)</m> to be equal to <m>f(a)</m>.
                Functions for which this is true, however, are known as <em>continuous functions</em> and will be very important in <xref ref="section-continuity" text="type-global" /> and beyond.

                We've got a handle on how to estimate limits from <xref ref="section-the-limit-of-a-function" text="type-global" />, but the process is very tedious.
                It requires either graphing the function in question or laboriously entering values into a calculator.
                So our first order of business now that we have the concept of a limit is to find an easier way to calculate it.
                This will be a running theme throughout the course.

            <p>
                In many cases of interest, we can use knowledge of simpler limits to obtain more complicated limits.
                We do this via the <term>Limit Laws</term>.
                Before we get to them, we'll state two very simple (and hopefully very believable) limits.

                        First, note that we can't use the Limit Laws right away since the denominator is <m>0</m> at <m>x=1</m>.
                        What we need to do is use algebra to simplify the expression inside the limit:

            In other words, <m>\lim_{x\to a}f(x) = f(a)</m>.

            If we're dealing with a function on a (bounded) closed interval, we need to introduce some new terminology.
            We say that a function <m>f(x)</m> is <term>continuous from the left</term> at <m>x=a</m> if <m>\lim_{x\to a^{-}}f(x) = f(a)</m>.
            Similarly, we say that <m>f(x)</m> is <term>continuous from the right</term> at <m>x=a</m> if <m>\lim_{x\to a^{+}}f(x) = f(a)</m>.
            This is of course assuming that <m>a</m> is in the domain of <m>f(x)</m>.
            Finally, we say that <m>f(x)</m> is continuous on the closed interval <m>[a,b]</m> if it is continuous on <m>(a,b)</m>, continuous from the right at <m>a</m> and continuous from the left at <m>b</m>.
            The main idea is still that the graph contains no gaps over this interval.

                    We need to check continuity at <m>s=-1</m> and <m>s=1</m>.
                    At <m>s=-1</m>, we need to make sure that <m>\lim_{s\to -1}g(s)</m> exists and is equal to <m>g(-1)</m>.
                    Since
                    <me>\lim_{s\to-1^{-1}}g(s) = \lim_{s\to-1^{-1}}s^{2} = 1</me>
                    and

                    it follows that <m>\lim_{s\to-1}g(s)</m> does not exist.
                    So <m>g(s)</m> can't be continuous at <m>s=-1</m>.

                    Since <m>g(1)</m> also equals <m>5</m>, <m>g(s)</m> is continuous at <m>s=1</m>.
                    So <m>g(s)</m> must be continuous on <m>(-\infty, -1)\cup(-1,\infty)</m>.

            <title>Limits Involving Vertical Asymptotes</title>
            <p>
                Consider the function <m>f(x)=\frac{1}{x}</m>.
                We know from algebra that this function has a vertical asymptote at <m>x=0</m>, and so in particular is undefined there.
                However, just because it's undefined at <m>x=0</m> doesn't mean that we can't gather important information about the function near <m>0</m>.
                This is because the function behaves in a very specific way as we let <m>x</m> approach <m>0</m>.
                For example, if we let <m>x</m> approach <m>0</m> from the right, then <m>f(x)</m> increases without bound.
                Similarly, <m>f(x)</m> decreases without bound as <m>x</m> approaches <m>0</m> from the left.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though <m>f(x)</m> is not approaching a specific value as <m>x</m> approaches <m>0</m> from either direction, this behavior shows up often enough and is important enough that we want to introduce notation to describe it.
                For this function, we would say <m>\lim_{x\to0^{+}}\frac{1}{x}=\infty</m> and <m>\lim_{x\to0^{-}}\frac{1}{x}=-\infty</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now consider <m>g(x) = \frac{1}{(x-3)^{2}}</m>.
                Then <m>\lim_{x\to3^{-}}g(x) = \lim_{x\to3^{+}}g(x) = \infty</m> since the function increases without bound when <m>x</m> approaches <m>3</m> from both directions.
                In this case, we say that <m>\lim_{x\to3}g(x)=\infty</m>.
            </p>
            <aside>
                <p>
                    It's <em>extremely</em> important to remember that the symbol <m>\infty</m> is not being used to represent a number or variable that we can perform algebra on.
                    It's a symbol indicating how a particular function is behaving at a certain point.

            <p>
                If <m>f(x)</m> is a function and <m>\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=\pm\infty</m>, <m>\lim_{x\to a^{-}}f(x)=\pm\infty</m> or <m>\lim_{x\to a^{+}}f(x)=\pm\infty</m>, then this means that the function has a vertical asymptote at <m>x=a</m>.
                In this course, this basically corresponds to a divide-by-zero problem.

                        If we try to plug in <m>x=4</m> into <m>\frac{x-3}{2x-8}</m> we get <m>\frac{1}{0}</m>, which means we have run into a divide-by-zero problem.
                        This is a good hint that the limit should be <m>\pm\infty</m>, we just need to figure out the correct sign.
                        There are a couple ways we can do this.
                        First, we could set up a sign chart for this function to see where it's positive and negative and then use that to see if it's increasing or decreasing without bound as <m>x\to4^{-}</m>.
                        Second, we could just plug in values of <m>x</m> that are closer and closer to <m>4</m> and see how the function behaves.
                        Either way, we see that it's negative for values of <m>x</m> that are close to (but less than) <m>4</m>.
                        Hence <m>\lim_{x\to4^{-}}\frac{x-3}{2x-8}=-\infty</m>.

                    The reason we were able to find the limit in <xref ref="example-a-limit-at-infinity-involving-sine" text="type-global" /> was because of the following fact: if <m>\lim_{x\to a}g(x)</m> exists and if <m>f(x)</m> is continuous at <m>\lim_{x\to a}g(x)</m>, then <m>\lim_{x\to a}f(g(x)) = f(\lim_{x\to a}g(x))</m>.

                        Let's start with <m>f(t)</m>.
                        To figure out what this limit should be, we could try the following.
                        As <m>t</m> gets very large the <m>t^{3}</m> term in the numerator should drown out everything else in the numerator.
                        Similarly, the <m>5t^{2}</m> term in the denominator should drown out everything else in the denominator.
                        So for <m>t</m> very large, <m>f(t)\approx\frac{t^{3}}{5t^{2}} = \frac{1}{5}t</m>.
                        Hence <m>f(t)</m> should probably go to <m>\infty</m> as <m>t</m> goes to <m>\infty</m>.
                        To make this more precise, we'll just divide the numerator and denominator by the largest power of the denominator, <m>t^{2}</m>, and then take the limit:

                        <md>
                            <mrow>\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{\sin\frac{1}{x}}{\frac{1}{x}} &amp; = \lim_{\theta\to0^{+}}\frac{\sin\theta}{\theta} </mrow>
                            <mrow> &amp; = 1. </mrow>
                        </md>
                        Therefore <m>\sin\frac{1}{x}\sim\frac{1}{x}</m>.
