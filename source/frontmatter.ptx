            This document was created to serve as a single source for
            my lecture notes for the calculus sequence at West
            Virginia Wesleyan College.  As such these notes are
            divided into three self-explanatory parts.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                      The first part, <xref ref="part-differential"
                      text="custom">Differential Calculus </xref>,
                      introduces the derivative and covers its
                      important properties and applications.  This
                      content forms the majority of the Calculus I
                      course.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                      The next part, <xref ref="part-integral"
                      text="custom">Integral Calculus </xref>,
                      introduces the integral and goes over multiple
                      methods for its calculation.  This content forms
                      the majority of the Calculus II course.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                      The final part, <xref ref="part-multivariable"
                      text="custom">Multivariable Calculus </xref>,
                      generalizes the concepts of derivatives and
                      integrals to two and three dimensions.  This
                      content forms basis of the Calculus III course.

          This document is very much <em>in progress </em> and
          therefore typos and other errors are to be expected.  If you
          find any, I would appreciate you letting me know by
          contacting me by email.
