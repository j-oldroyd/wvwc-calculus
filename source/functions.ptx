            The primary object of study in calculus is the function.

            <p>
                The most basic example of a function that we'll study in calculus is the <em>linear function</em>.

                    <p>
                        A <term>linear function</term> is a function <m>f(x)</m> of the form
                        <me>f(x) = mx + b</me>
                        for constants <m>m</m> and <m>b</m>.

            <p>
                As the name suggests, any (non-vertical) line is an example of a linear function.
                Such functions are completely determined by the slope of the corresponding line and the <m>y</m>-intercept.
                <aside>
                    <p>
                        Equivalently, any line is determined by knowing two distinct points on the line.
                    </p>
                </aside>
                In particular, if <m>y = mx + b</m> then <m>m</m> is the slope and <m>b</m> is the <m>y</m>-intercept.
                This is known as the <em>slope-intercept</em> equation of a line.
                Equations of lines are also often written in <em>point-slope form</em> as <m>y - y_{0} = m(x - x_{0})</m>.

                So linear functions are just polynomial functions of degree at most <m>1</m>.
                And just as linear functions are determined by knowing two distinct points on the line, any polynomial functions is determined by knowing <m>n+1</m> distinct points on the polynomial.

                The operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, taking whole number powers and taking whole number roots applied to polynomials give rise to <em>algebraic functions</em>.
                Two particularly important examples are <em>rational functions</em> and <em>root functions</em>.

                As functions become more complicated, we have to worry more and more about their domains.
                For a polynomial function, the domain is the set of all real numbers <m>\mathbb{R}</m> (if we ignore complex numbers).
                The domain of a rational function is the set of all numbers where the denominator is nonzero.
                The domain of a root function is the set of all nonnegative numbers.

                  We need to find where both the radicand <m>x^{2} - 3x + 2</m> is nonnegative and where <m>3x + 4 \neq 0</m>.
                  If we solve <m>x^{2} - 3x + 2 \geq 0</m>, we see that <m>x</m> must be in <m>(-\infty, 1]\cup [2,\infty)</m>.
                  Likewise, <m>3x + 4\neq 0</m> if and only if <m>x \neq -\frac{4}{3}</m>.
                  Hence the domain is
                  <me>(-\infty, -\frac{4}{3})\cup (-\frac{4}{3}, 1]\cup[2,\infty)</me>.

                Consider the unit circle in <m>\RR^2</m>, which is given by <m>x^2 + y^2 = 1</m>.
                Each point <m>P</m> on this circle makes an angle <m>\theta</m> with the positive <m>x</m>-axis, and therefore <m>\theta</m> must also determine the point completely.
                The angle <m>\theta</m> is typically specified using either <em>radians</em> or <em>degrees</em>.
                Converting from one unit to the other can be done by noting that <m>\pi</m> radians is precisely equal to <m>180</m> degrees.
