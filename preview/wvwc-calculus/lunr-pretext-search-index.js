As the name suggests, any (non-vertical) line is an example of a linear function. Such functions are completely determined by the slope of the corresponding line and the -intercept.  Equivalently, any line is determined by knowing two distinct points on the line.  In particular, if then is the slope and is the -intercept. This is known as the slope-intercept equation of a line.

If , then we say that has degree .   So linear functions are just polynomial functions of degree at most . And just as linear functions are determined by knowing two distinct points on the line, any polynomial functions is determined by knowing distinct points on the polynomial.

Algebraic Functions  The operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, taking whole number powers and taking whole number roots applied to polynomials give rise to algebraic functions .

A root function is a function of the form for some natural number .    As functions become more complicated, we have to worry more and more about their domains. For a polynomial function, the domain is the set of all real numbers (if we ignore complex numbers). The domain of a rational function is the set of all numbers where the denominator is nonzero. The domain of a root function is the set of all nonnegative numbers.   Finding the Domain of an Algebraic Function   Find the domain of .

  "body": " The limit of a function   Motivating limits  Imagine creating a mathematical valley out of the graph of , and in this valley walks a mathematical ant. The ant is walking towards the place on the hill directly above . At , the ant is units above the ground. At , the ant is now unit above the ground. As the ant moves towards , its height above the ground gets closer and closer to . To say it more clearly, and because modern calculus is built on this idea, as the ant approaches the point above , its height above the ground approaches the value . In other words, the limit of as approaches is .   A mathematical valley minus a mathematical ant      Remember that a function of the variable is just a rule that turns one number, , into another number, . So the idea that the limit of a function is trying to express is what happens to the number (the output) as the number (the input) approaches some particular value.   Actually, functions are much more general than this. But for calculus, it won't hurt us to view functions in this way.   We're not quite ready to define the limit of a function precisely, but we can point one thing out right away: the limit of a function requires two pieces of information: the function itself and the number that is approaching. The limit should then be whatever number that is approaching.   Estimating the limit of a trigonometric function   Let . What is the limit of as approaches the number ?    We don't have a lot of tools to find limits yet, so we'll try to estimate it instead. What we'll do is we'll plug numbers that are closer and closer to into . Let's list several values of as gets closer to from the left:   Estimating                     We can even let approach from the other direction as well (i.e. \"from the right\") and will still approach as gets closer and closer to . So it looks like the limit should be .    To keep ourselves from writing \"the limit of as approaches some number \" over and over, let's introduce some notation: .   Limit of a piecewise function   Let Find .    If we graph this function, we see that at there is a jump in the graph. In particular, if approaches from the left then approaches , whereas if approaches from the right then approaches . So this function does not appear to have an unambiguous limit as approaches . Another way to say this:  does not exist .     shows us something very important about limits: they depend on the two different ways can approach a number. So we introduce two new pieces of notation: the left-hand limit  will stand for the value approaches (if any) as approaches from the left (i.e. as increases to ), and the right-hand limit  will stand for the value approaches (if any) as approaches from the right (i.e. as decreases to ). In , we would say that .  At this point, we can make a rough definition for the limit of a function.   Limit of a function  limit function of a single variable   Let be a function. Suppose that both the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit exist and are equal to the same number . Then we say that the limit of as approaches exists and is equal to . We denote this by writing .     Piecewise function again   Let be given by Evaluate and .    If we graph , we get the following:   Graphing      The graph shows us that , while . Therefore does not exist. On the other hand, exists and is equal to .    It's important to note that the value of a function at a point is in general completely independent of the value of , i.e., we can't always expect to be equal to . Functions for which this is true, however, are known as continuous functions and will be very important in and beyond.   "

The limit laws  In many cases of interest, we can use knowledge of simpler limits to obtain more complicated limits. We do this via the Limit Laws .

Is continuous on ?    If we graph , then we see that it is discontinuous at . Therefore is discontinuous on the interval .    If we're dealing with a function on a (bounded) closed interval, we need to introduce some new terminology. We say that a function is continuous from the left at if . Similarly, we say that is continuous from the right at if . This is of course assuming that is in the domain of . Finally, we say that is continuous on the closed interval if it is continuous on , continuous from the right at and continuous from the left at .

If we graph over this interval, we get the following:   Graphing over      So from the graph it appears that is continuous on this interval.    Remember that we said a function is continuous over an interval if its graph has no gaps over that interval. This is a very rough explanation of continuity, but it should make the following theorem plausible.   Continuous functions   Polynomial, rational, root and trigonometric functions are continuous at every point of their domain.      Combining continuous functions  Although it doesn't directly mention piecewise functions, is still useful for determining if they are continuous. If a piecewise function is defined using any of the functions from , then the only points we really need to check for continuity are the the places where the function \"changes rules\".   Another piecewise function   Over what intervals is the function given by continuous?    We need to check continuity at and . At , we need to make sure that exists and is equal to . Since and it follows that does not exist. So can't be continuous at .  On the other hand, since , it follows that exists and is equal to . Since also equals , is continuous at . So must be continuous on .  Note that we can also verify this result graphically by looking for jumps in the graph. For example, see below produced using Desmos (you can also produce graphs using the Calc button).   Graph of      We can also build more complicated continuous functions out of simpler ones.   Combining continuous functions   Let and be continuous at a point .

Since and are all continuous, this means that must be continuous as well. Therefore       We've seen that continuous functions are precisely those functions that make limits easy to compute.

  "body": " Limits involving infinity   Limits are used to describe the behavior of a function as approaches some quantity. In this section, we will see how limits can be used to describe singularities of functions (which appear as vertical asymptotes) and long-term behavior of functions (which usually appear as horizontal asymptotes).    Limits involving vertical asymptotes  Consider the function . We know from algebra that this function has a vertical asymptote at , and so in particular is undefined there. However, just because it's undefined at doesn't mean that we can't gather important information about the function near . This is because the function behaves in a very specific way as we let approach . For example, if we let approach from the right, then increases without bound. Similarly, decreases without bound as approaches from the left.  Even though is not approaching a specific value as approaches from either direction, this behavior shows up often enough and is important enough that we want to introduce notation to describe it. For this function, we would say and .  Now consider . Then since the function increases without bound when approaches from both directions. In this case, we say that .   It's extremely important to remember that the symbol is not being used to represent a number or variable that we can perform algebra on. It's a symbol indicating how a particular function is behaving at a certain point.   If is a function and , or , then this means that the function has a vertical asymptote at . In this course, this basically corresponds to a divide-by-zero problem.   Infinite limit involving a rational function   Determine .    If we try to plug in into we get , which means we have run into a divide-by-zero problem. This is a good hint that the limit should be , we just need to figure out the correct sign. There are a couple ways we can do this. First, we could set up a sign chart for this function to see where it's positive and negative and then use that to see if it's increasing or decreasing without bound as . Second, we could just plug in values of that are closer and closer to and see how the function behaves. Either way, we see that it's negative for values of that are close to (but less than) . Hence .      Limits at infinity  The previous subsection involved limits of functions whose values approached . Now we look at what can happen to a function if its input values approach . First, a definition of sorts.   Limit at infinity   Let be a function. We say that if gets (and stays) arbitrarily close to as is made arbitrarily large. Similarly, we say that if gets (and stays) arbitrarily close to as is made arbitrarily small.     An important limit at infinity   Let . Determine .    As gets arbitrarily large, gets arbitrarily close to . Therefore .     holds for many other reciprocal powers of . In particular, if then .   A limit at infinity involving cosine   Let . Compute .    First, note that . By the previous remark, we know that . Therefore .     The reason we were able to find the limit in was because of the following fact: if exists and if is continuous at , then . Basically, we can swap continuous functions with limits without causing any harm.   For limits at infinity involving powers of a variable, it is the highest power variables that determine the outcome.   Limit at infinity of a rational function   Let Find and .    Let's start with . To figure out what this limit should be, we could try the following. As gets very large the term in the numerator should drown out everything else in the numerator. Similarly, the term in the denominator should drown out everything else in the denominator. So for very large, . Hence should probably go to as goes to . To make this more precise, we'll just divide the numerator and denominator by the largest power of the denominator, , and then take the limit: .  We can find using the same idea. Just divide by the highest power in the denominator and then take the limit: .    These limits at infinity have a graphical meaning as well. If or exists and is equal to , then the line is a horizontal asymptote of the graph of .   Asymptotic equivalence   Two functions and are said to be asymptotically equivalent , written , if the following is true: Show that .    All we need to do is compute  . Therefore .      Now that we've used limits to describe function behaviors that we are already familiar with, such as gaps in graphs and asymptotes, we will move on to using limits to define new concepts of importance. In we will introduce the first such concept, and one of the most important concepts in calculus as a whole: that of the derivative of a function.   "

What we'd like to do is to find a way to describe how quickly this parabola is changing at a point, i.e. find the \"slope\" of the parabola. One way to try to deal with this is to use secant lines . Recall that the secant line through the points and has slope , which is just the average rate of change of from to . If is very close to , then the slope of the secant line through these points should be a good approximation to the \"slope\" of at the point .   Secant lines on a parabola   Let . Find the slope of the secant line through and .    Since the slope of the secant line is the average rate of change, we get that the slope must be equal to     What is telling us is that if , then the slope of at should be very close to , the slope of the secant line. Now we'll do a trick that shows up everywhere in calculus, and is the entire reason we introduced limits in the first place. We'll make this approximation exact by taking a limit. In particular, we'll say that the slope of should be equal to This is the slope of the tangent line to at . Instead of an average rate of change over an interval , we now have an instantaneous rate of change at a point .   Tangent lines   The tangent line to a curve through a point is the line passing through with slope given by assuming this limit exists. The slope of the tangent line represents the slope of the graph of at and gives the instantaneous rate of change of at .     Tangent line to a root   Find the equation of the tangent line to through the point .    We need two things to find the equation of a line: the slope of the line and a point on the line. Since we know the tangent line has to pass through , we just need to find the slope. The slope is given by Hence the equation of the tangent line through is     As a reminder, the slope of the tangent line represents the slope, or instantaneous rate of change, of the function.   Velocity from position   The displacement (i.e. position) of a particle moving in a straight line is described by the function , where is in seconds and is in meters. Find the velocity, or instantaneous rate of change, of the particle at .    The velocity is just the slope of the tangent line to at , which we can find as follows: .  At this step it's a little unclear where to go next, so we'll try long division. If we do so, we get Hence the velocity must be meters per second.     was a little tricky because we needed to compute , and it was unclear how to simplify this at first. This stemmed in large part from how we computed the velocity in the first place, using the formula or more generally .  We want to rewrite this formula to make it a little easier to work with in certain cases. We'll do this by making the denominator easier to handle. In particular, set . Then Either formula can be used to compute the slope of the tangent line.   Velocity revisited   Let be given as in . Find the velocity at .    We know that the velocity should be , but we'll try to find it again using our new formula. So the velocity should also be .    Typically, if is easy to factor in terms of we'll want to use the first formula we had for computing rates of change. Otherwise, we'll stick with the new formula involving .    The derivative  Suppose we go back to one more time, but now we want to find the velocity of at an arbitrary number . Then we could still use our limit formulas, which would give us .  So the velocity at of the particle modeled by is given by . So we can represent the velocity, or rate of change or slope of the tangent line, by a function. We call this the derivative .

Graph of        We've mentioned before that continuous functions are functions whose graphs can be drawn without lifting your pencil off of the page. Likewise, differentiable functions are functions whose graphs can be drawn \"smoothly\", without any sudden movements or cusps, and without drawing a vertical tangent line. If we think about these two concepts, we may suspect that a differentiable function is also continuous. If we can draw a graph smoothly, we certainly can't lift our pencil off the page to draw it. The next theorem makes this precise.   Differentiable functions are continuous   Let be a function that is differentiable at . Then is continuous at .    We need to show that exists and is equal to . To do this, we'll start by considering (somewhat counterintuitively) : . Note that we are using our alternate definition of the derivative here.  Now we can prove that as follows: . So , which means that is continuous at .    At this point we might think that a continuous function should also be differentiable, but this is not the case.   A continuous function that is not differentiable at a point   Let . Show that is not differentiable at .    If we graph it looks like it shouldn't be differentiable at because of the cusp. We'll try to prove this mathematically by showing that the limit in doesn't exist if . First, we'll compute the left hand limit: . Now, the right hand limit: . Since these limits are different, does not exist. Hence is not differentiable at .     You may think that a continuous function must at least be differentiable \"almost everywhere\" at this point. After all, how could it be possible to draw a graph without lifting your pencil off the paper that still has a cusp or a vertical tangent line everywhere ? Most mathematicians before the century thought this as well, until Weierstrass came up with a function, the Weierstrass function , that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere .     Higher order derivatives   Acceleration from position   The position of some particle moving in a line is given by , where is in seconds and is in meters. Find , the acceleration of the particle at time .    Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, and velocity is the rate of change of position. So we should probably find the velocity first! Let's call it . We have . Now we can get the acceleration as well: .    In , we had to take two derivatives of the original function in order to get the acceleration . In other words, acceleration is the second derivative of position . So , which we also write as or . This is an example of a second-order derivative . In general, we have the following definition.   -order derivatives  derivative -order derivative   Let be a function. The -order derivative of is the function obtained by differentiating  times. This function is denoted by . If or , we typically write , and instead of or .    Although it gets more difficult to assign a physical or geometric significance to higher order derivatives, we can still derive meaning from the second derivative. One interpretation of the second derivative is as acceleration, as shown in , and it turns out there's a nice geometric interpretation as well. Recall that if is a function then represents the slope, or rate of change, of the graph of at . Therefore represents the rate of change of the slope, i.e. how quickly the slope is increasing or decreasing. If then the slope of should be increasing, leading to a u-shaped graph. Conversely, if then the slope of should be decreasing, leading to an upside down u-shaped graph. This leads to the following definition.   Concavity   Let be a function with second derivative . We say that is concave up (respectively, concave down ) on an interval if (respectively, ) on that interval.    So functions that are concave up on an interval tend to be u-shaped on that interval, and functions that are concave down tend to be upside down u-shaped. See .   Concavity                  "

Perhaps the easiest rule is the constant rule , which just says that the derivative of a constant is . We'll derive more complicated rules in this section and the next two.    The power rule and trigonometric derivatives  Our first goal will be to determine a general formula for the derivative of for some power .

Derivatives of sums and constant multiples  Now that we have derivative formulas for some basic functions, we want to extend these to more complicated functions. For this section we'll look at what happens when we multiply a function by a constant or add it to another function. In the next two sections we'll consider more advanced rules.   Constant multiple rule  derivative differentiation formulas constant multiple rule   Let be differentiable function and let be some constant. Then .    To prove this, we go back to : .

To get the graph of from , just reflect the graph of across the line .   Graphing the inverse of the natural exponential   Let . Graph .    If we graph and then rotate the graph across the line , we get the graph in .   The inverse of .          Calculus with inverse functions  There are two important things to notice about the graph of the inverse function in : it's continuous and differentiable. This is because the same was true of the original graph, and if we think about it this should be true in general as well since graphing the inverse doesn't add any new gaps or cusps to the graph.   Continuity and differentiability of inverses  functions invertible functions continuity   Let be a continuous (respectively, differentiable) function. Suppose that is invertible, and has inverse . Then is continuous (respectively, differentiable).     Finding the derivative of an inverse function   Let and note that is invertible. Find the derivative of .    One way to do this is just start by finding . So we'll set , solve for and then switch and . If we do this, we get so (and note that the domain of is since this is the range of !). Hence .    The method used in will certainly work in simple cases. But what do we do if we can't (or don't want to) find an explicit formula for the inverse function? The following formula will help us to do this.   Derivative of an inverse function  functions invertible functions derivatives  derivative differentiation formulas invertible functions   Let be a differentiable function with inverse . Assume that is itself differentiable. Then .    First, let , so that we need to find . Then we can say that . Now differentiate this equation implicitly to get or just .     Exponential inverse revisited   Using the fact that the derivative of is itself, find the derivative of its inverse.    Let . Then by we have . So the derivative of the inverse of is .     Derivative at a point   Let . Find     By , we know that . By inspection, which means . Since , this gives .      Derivatives of exponentials  We've already mentioned that , but we've said nothing about differentiating functions such as or . However, it turns out that we can get these derivatives from the derivative of without too much trouble.   Derivatives of exponential functions  exponential functions derivatives  derivative differentiation formulas exponential functions   Let and set . Then .    To prove this, we need to use what's available to us: the derivative of . From we say that . More generally, we can also say that . Hence .     Differentiating an exponential   Let . Find .    If we set , then . By the chain rule, .    Although we certainly want to know the derivative of , or at least how to find it, most applications involving exponential functions use the natural exponential function instead. The derivative of is probably the most important derivative in this course.   Solutions of a differential equation   Show that satisfies the differential equation , where are arbitrary constants.    We need to show that if we compute and and plug these expressions into the differential equation, this will simplify out to . Since , it follows that .    Exponential functions often appear in the solutions of differential equations, which are themselves often viewed as mathematical models of physical systems. Hence exponential functions play a significant role in predicting physical quantities, which goes a long way towards justifying their importance.    Derivatives of logarithms  Just as we can get the derivative of every exponential function just by knowing the derivative of , we can get the derivative of every logarithmic function just by knowing that .   Derivatives of logarithmic functions  logarithm functions derivatives   Let and set . Then .     Differentiating nested logarithms   Let . Find .    By the chain rule, we have ,    Logarithms can be used to greatly simplify derivatives involving products, division or exponentiation using a technique known as logarithmic differentiation .   A simple fraction   Let . Find .    We can find without resorting to logarithms, but this would require using the product, quotient and chain rules. The algebra would be awful. So we'll using logarithms instead! Set . Then . Now we differentiate both sides implicitly to obtain .  Hence .    Logarithmic differentiation is useful for finding derivatives of expressions containing complicated quotients, products or powers.   A simple exponent   Let . Find .    We'll use logarithmic differentiation again to simplify and remove the exponent. Set , which gives . So , which means that .     "

A reasonable, though simplistic, assumption is that the disease will spread quicker if more people are infected. In other words, we'll assume that the rate at which people are infected is proportional to the number of people infected. If we let denote the number of people infected at time , then we're basically saying that for some constant .  This differential equation is a mathematical model that allows us to predict the growth of . We can actually use it to get an expression for . This differential equation is saying that is a function whose derivative looks quite a bit like . In fact, the solution of this differential equation is , where is a constant that represents the number of people infected at time . This is an example of exponential growth , and the proportionality constant is called the relative growth rate .   Modeling an outbreak   A game of Humans vs. Zombies breaks out at WVWC. When the game starts, there is just one zombie. After one hour, there are zombies. How many zombies will there be after three hours assuming that the relative growth rate is constant?    Let denote the number of zombies hours after the game starts. Then we're given that and . We need to find .  Since the relative growth rate is assumed to be constant, we can say that for some constant . As we saw before, the solution of this differential equation is given by . So if we want to find , then we need to figure out what is.  We can do this by using the fact that . If we plug this into , we get . So . Hence there will be zombies after three hours.      Exponential decay  Closely related to the concept of exponential growth is that of exponential decay . A quantity undergoes exponential decay if it satisfies the differential equation , where . Every solution of this differential equation looks like .   We often write the decay constant as positive, and then rewrite the ODE for as . The solution becomes . This has the effect of highlighting the negative growth rate inherent to this system.   Perhaps the most important example of exponential decay is that of radioactive decay. If represents the mass of some radioactive substance, then experiments show that substance decays at a rate proportional to the amount of the substance remaining. In symbols, where . If we let denote the initial mass of the substance, then we can say that . The rate of decay is often expressed in terms of half-life : the amount of time it will take for precisely half of the mass to decay.   Decay from half-life   A radioactive substance has a half-life of days. If we start with a 50 sample, how much of the mass will remain after days?    If we let denote the mass of the sample at time , and let denote the first day we have the sample, then . We still need to find , but we can do this using the fact that the half-life is days.

Roughly, local maxima correspond to \"hilltops\" whereas local minima correspond to \"valleys\" in the graph of .    In general, local extrema and absolute extrema can be different. However, the following theorem does provide a relationship between the two on closed, bounded intervals.   Extreme Value Theorem  Extreme Value Theorem   Let be a continuous function defined on the interval Then has both an absolute maximum and absolute minimum on . Furthermore, these values occur at either an endpoint or a local extrema.    What tells us is that we can find the extreme values of any continuous function defined on a closed, bounded interval by just checking the function at the endpoint and at its local extrema.   Finding extreme values   Let .

Since is the only local extreme value inside of our interval, that's the only one we need to check. We have So the absolute minimum of on is and the absolute maximum is     So if we can find where a function has local extrema, then finding absolute extrema won't be too much more difficult. Thankfully, this is relatively straightforward if the function is differentiable.   Fermat's Theorem  Fermat's Theorem   Let be a function and let be a local extreme value of . If exists, then .    So finding local extrema of often amounts to finding where , i.e., where it has a root. However, we also need to worry about where doesn't exist (just think about ).

Our method for finding extreme values on a closed interval will proceed as follows: find all the critical points, and then compare the values of our function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval.

If we replace with , then this means we need to minimize The critical point of is , and since is a parabola we know that this must be the location of the absolute minimum value on the graph. So the numbers we need are .     Minimizing material costs   A box with an open top and a square base is to be built using material that costs \\$5 per square meter. The box must have a volume of 32000 . Find the dimensions of the box that will be cheapest to build to these specifications.    There are two things we need to do here:  Find the quantity to be optimize.  Solve the resulting optimization problem.  We need to minimize costs, which means we need to minimize how much material is used to construct this box. Hence we must minimize the surface area of the box. If we let denote the length of the base of the box and the height of the box, then the surface area is given by Now, we can't minimize this yet because we have too many variables. However, we can solve for in terms of by using the volume constraint. Since the volume of the box is this gives So the quantity we need to minimize is   To minimize this, we find the critical points by solving . This gives, after some algebra, . Now we need to be careful here! We only have a critical point at this step. We need to make an argument now as to why this critical point should be an absolute minimum of . One way to do this is by setting up a sign chart for . If we do this, then we see that for in , while for in . If we think about what this tells us of the graph of , we see that must minimize , at least for . So the dimensions that minimize the cost of building this box are .

  "title": "The Mean Value Theorem",
  "body": " The Mean Value Theorem   The linear approximations we came up with in are useful for estimating complicated functions with simpler, linear models. In essence, we use the derivative of a function to tell us how much to change a given value of the function in order to estimate that function. There is one problem with this approach, at least currently. We have good reason to suspect that our approximations are close to the exact values in certain circumstances, but we don't know how close. The goal of this section is to derive an estimate for the derivative that can help us to find more precise approximations.    Rolle's Theorem  We start with a theorem that is very reasonable, at least geometrically. Let be a differentiable function on some interval , and suppose . Then this means the graph of must \"turn around\" at some point in , i.e., there is a local maximum or minimum contained within the interval. Combining this observation with gives us Rolle's Theorem.    Rolle's Theorem   Let be a differentiable function on and suppose . Then there exists some number in such that .     is an example of an existence theorem . It tells us nothing about how to find the number , or how many such can exist. It only tells us that there is at least one number in for which . This may not seem very useful, but existence theorems can be quite powerful in mathematics.   Rolle's Theorem and Traffic   A car enters a highway going at 45 and leaves the highway going at the same speed. Was the car's acceleration ever ?    The speed of the car can be represented by a velocity function . If we assume that the car entered the highway at time and left at some future time , then we know that By , there must be some time between and for which . Since is exactly the acceleration, we know that the car had to stop accelerating somewhere on the highway.      The Mean Value Theorem   is powerful because it has very general conditions for its use. However, it does require the function in question to take on the same values at the endpoints of , and this is a condition we'd like to try to relax. However, we'll try to be clever about this and use to do most of the heavy lifting for us.  If we imagine graphing some differentiable function on some interval , but , then we can't apply . But maybe we can adjust it just a little bit so that we can? In particular, the only reason we can't use is that . But if we subtract the line through these points from , we should get a new function for which applies.  The line through these points has equation So define Then So  does apply to this function. Hence there exists some number between and for which .  But and if this is then we can solve for to get This gives us the Mean Value Theorem .   Mean Value Theorem  Mean Value Theorem   Let be differentiable on some interval . Then there exists a number in such that or equivalently     The essentially says that there is at least one point inside of for which the slope at that point matches the \"average slope\" Like , this is an existence theorem. However, it's slightly more general, and so is applicable in more situations. It's also useful in deriving error estimates.   Estimating error in a linear approximation   Let and let denote the linear approximation to at . Find the largest possible error between and on the interval .    First, we should find , which from is just The error we need to estimate is , for in . So we'll set and let be some number in . By , there exists some number in such that Now, and .

If for all in , then has to be a constant.    The idea of the proof is to use to show that for any points in . Now, by we have for some in . However, by assumption, and so . In other words, .

Then the most general antiderivative of is where is an arbitrary constant.    It might not seem like this statement requires a proof, but it does! We can check very easily that every function of the form is an antiderivative of , but how do we know every antiderivative takes this form? To prove this, let be an arbitrary antiderivative of . Then we need to show that , or equivalently that . We can do this by taking the derivative of to get and so by we know that must be constant on . Hence for some constant , or equivalently . Therefore every antiderivative of can be written as .

Take downward to be the negative direction and sea level to be . Since acceleration is the second derivative of position, then the position (i.e. height) of the object should be the second antiderivative of acceleration. At this step, it's tempting to say that since , we have . And indeed, is a function whose second derivative is . However, we have a slight problem here. We know that and . If , then it's impossible for to equal . The problem here is we forgot about the arbitrary constants.  To get an accurate expression for , we go back to . Then for some constant .

In order to actually find the antiderivative, we'll rewrite into a more convenient form. First, note that the numerator is very close to the denominator, which means we can almost cancel it out. So we'll split up the numerator as follows:   We can find the antiderivative of this term by term, so the most general antiderivative of is     At this point, it's natural to think about what an antiderivative means geometrically since the derivative of a function has such a nice interpretation. One approach to this is to think about net change of the antiderivative. Let be an antiderivative of on some interval containing . The net change of from to is given by Now, represents instantaneous rate of change, not net change. However, if we can somehow add these instantaneous changes from to , they should accumulate until they give the net change of from to . Graphically, adding these instantaneous rates of change looks like it's giving us the area under , which suggests the following geometric interpretation: the area under of from to is just the net change of an antiderivative from to . Much of the next chapter is devoted to making this idea precise.  "

  "title": "Areas Under Curves",
  "body": " Areas Under Curves  We know how to find areas of simple shapes, such as rectangles, triangles and circles. But how can we find the area of a more complicated shape? Say, for example, the area under from to ? Well, if we don't know it exactly then we can at least approximate it using a shape we do know. For example, using rectangles.  A simple way to divide the graph of using rectangles is to pick several equally spaced points in the interval , say and then draw rectangles using these points to determine the base of each rectangle and the height of the graph above the points to determine the height of each rectangle. In particular, we will have three rectangles; the first with base , the second with base and the third with base . Now, the height of each rectangle comes from a point on the graph above the corresponding interval. To make these specific (and relatively straightforward), we'll use right endpoints to determine the height of each rectangle. So the height of each respective rectangle is given by , and by .  Now, if we add up the areas of these rectangles we get an approximation for the area under the graph. Call these areas . So the area under the graph of from to is about   There's nothing stopping us from going further here. For example, we pick rectangles, each with base length and heights determined by right endpoints as above, then the area of all of the rectangles will be an approximation (in fact, an overestimate) of the area of . The bases of these rectangles are given by So the areas of these rectangles are Adding these up, we get or just So if we sent to , we should get the exact area. In other words, the area under from to is given by   Actually finding this limit requires some trickery. It's not at all obvious, but we can write Hence So the exact area under from to is . Note that this matches up with our intuition from the last chapter: the area should be equal to the net change of an antiderivative. In this case, an antiderivative of is , and the net change of from to is exactly .  The process we used above for can be carried out for any continuous function. If we have a function defined on the interval , we can approximate the area under the graph by using rectangles. First, we split into different subintervals , each of width and where The approximate area under the graph of from to is then We can now define the area under a graph of a continuous function. Again, the idea is to approximate the graph with more and more rectangles.   Area   The area under the graph of a continuous function is the limit of the sum of the areas of the approximating rectangles:     Although the previous definition used right endpoints to find the height of each rectangle, this doesn't have to be the case. We can use left endpoints, midpoints or any other sample points  , where each is a point in the interval   Since finding areas in this way requires writing complicated sums, it seems like a good idea at this point to introduce notation for writing large summations. We call this sigma notation . Sigma notation takes the following form: To evaluate such an expression, just plug in the different values for from start to finish and add up what you get.   Evaluating a sum   Determine     We start at and finish at . Plugging all of these values in for , we get the following table:  Table of values for                                So we can say that      Using sigma notation   Use sigma notation to write the sum of all squares from to .    We need to start at and stop at . So the first component of this sum using sigma notation looks like . Now we just need to figure out what goes inside of it. Since we're adding squares of numbers, we'll just put inside of this sum. Hence the sum of all squares from to can be denoted     Sigma notation has some useful properties, since it's just another way to write sums.   Properties of Sigma Notation   Let and let . Let be a constant. Then the following are true: In other words, we can break sigma notation up over addition and subtraction, and we can move constants outside of it.     Areas using sigma notation   Write down a limit that gives the area under from to using sigma notation.    First, note that we can rewrite using sigma notation as We know what is, so we just need to identify and . isn't too bad here, it's just The are a little more complicated, but we'll still use right endpoints to find them. So we have In general, for .  Now we have everything we need to write our limit. Hence the area under from to is given by     Just as the problem of finding the slope of a tangent line can be viewed as a rate of change problem, the problem of finding areas can be viewed as an accumulation problem .   Finding work done   In physics, the work done by a constant force on some particle that moves a displacement is given by the formula How should we define the work done by a variable force?    The main idea here is to treat the variable force as the combination of several constant forces. To be specific, let denote our force (which depends on position ) and suppose it acts on a particle moving from to . itself may not be constant, but if we break up into subintervals of the form each of length , then should be nearly constant on each subinterval. So we can pick points from each subinterval and say that for all in .  Now we can approximate the work done by as the particle moves through the subinterval . The work done should be about equal to . Now, if we add up these estimates for each subinterval, we see that the total work done should be approximated by which suggests that we should define the exact work done to be     Note that was not written in terms of finding areas, but still involved the limit from . This tells us that the ideas in this section have a wider use than in just finding areas under curves.  "

  "title": "The Definite Integral",
  "body": " The Definite Integral  The process used in can be generalized quite a bit. Start with a function defined on some interval , and divide into subintervals where and each subinterval has length (i.e. ). This is known as a partition of . Then we can choose sample points from , from , all the way up to from . Note that the only restriction we're placing on the sample point is that is must come from the interval , but it may be any point in this interval.  The partition and sample points selected are now used to determine a sum that represents an approximation to the area under the curve: Geometrically, this sum represents the areas of multiple rectangles added together. Since these sums are essential for what follows, we will give them a name.   Riemann Sum  Riemann sum   Let with and let be a function defined on the interval . Let be a partition of and choose corresponding sample points for . Then a Riemann sum is a sum of the form where .    Although this can be more complicated than our definition in , it still approximates the area under from to . And as each subinterval in this partition gets smaller (i.e. as or equivalently as ), then this approximation should become exact, at least if is nice enough (see for a more precise statement).   The Definite Integral   Let be a function defined on . Then the definite integral of from to is the number provided that the limit exists (and that ). If this limit exists, we say that is integrable on .    We can use to rewrite our area definition: the area under from to is defined to be the definite integral of on , assuming it exists. For a function to be integrable, the particular partition of that we use cannot affect the limit in . This gives us a great deal of freedom in approximating the definite integral\/area under a curve: when choosing sample points, we can use left endpoints; right endpoints; midpoints and more. However, if is integrable then we lose nothing by just using right endpoints and subintervals of equal length, as in .   Integrability of Piecewise Continuous Functions   Let be a bounded, piecewise continuous function on with finitely many jump discontinuities. Then is integrable on . In particular, continuous functions are always integrable on bounded, closed intervals.    All of the functions that we will work with will be piecewise continuous, and many important quantities in mathematics and its applications can be represented by bounded, piecewise continuous functions. Definite integrals of such quantities therefore exist and are often used as a measure of accumulation. In particular, can be generalized to provide the following definition of work done by a force.   Work  work   Let denote the force acting on a particle over . The work done by the force on the particle as it moves from to is defined to be .     Expressing work done   A particle moving from to is acted upon by the force . Find the work done by the force on this particle.    Using , we see that the work done should be Since the definite integral represents area, and the definite integral of exists (since this is continuous), then we can see from that    Note that regions underneath the -axis correspond to negative areas!    A graph of the force and shaded areas corresponding to work.   A graph of a function representing force and shaded areas representing work.       In we used the connection between definite integrals and areas to find the work done. For the moment, this is our only method for calculating definite integrals. We will develop other methods starting in , but the connection between definite integrals and areas is an important one that we will make use of frequently.   A radical integral   Determine .    We won't be able to solve this integral algebraically until Calculus 2, but we can solve it geometrically instead. If we graph , we get the upper half of the circle of radius centered at the origin, as seen in . So the integral given must be exactly one-fourth the area of this circle, so    The graph of .   The graph of the top half of the circle of radius two centered at the origin.       Since the definite integral is defined as a limit of sums, it shares many properties with sums. In particular, we have the following version of    Properties of the Definite Integral   Let and be integrable on and let be a constant. Let be any number in . Then the following are true: In other words, we can break definite integrals up over addition and subtraction, and we can move constants outside of it.    Computing integrals in practice often involves setting up and approximating Riemann sums . These sums depend on how we choose the sample points from each interval . We've mostly worked with , or right endpoints. We could also choose , using left endpoints. However, it's often more accurate to use midpoints : . The reason for this is that if we choose midpoints of intervals as our sample points, these tend to be less affected than either endpoint if the function is increasing or decreasing. In particular, we have the midpoint rule .   Midpoint Rule   Let be a continuous function. Then where . Note that this rule calls for evenly dividing into a partition where each subinterval has equal length .    Replacing the midpoints in with corresponding left endpoints (respectively, right endpoints) gives the left endpoint rule (respectively, the right endpoint rule ). Together with the midpoint rule, these approximations are .   Careful! In general, .    Approximating an integral   Approximate using Riemann sums with .    For this integral, we have We will have different estimates using left endpoints, right endpoints and midpoints. Using left endpoints, we have Using midpoints, we have Using right endpoints, we have   Geometrically, we see that The exact value of this integral is actually , and we see that , the midpoint estimate, is clearly the best approximation to the integral in this case.    As gets larger, ideally the approximations produced by the midpoint and endpoint rules become more exact. The figure below is adapted from an example by Marshall Hampton located at and approximates integrals of the form . This makes use of the computer algebra system Sage which is itself based on the Python language.   Numerical integrals using the midpoint, left endpoint and right endpoint rules    The geometric interpretation of definite integrals as areas also suggests the following formulas. These can be useful for simplifying and estimating certain definite integrals.   More Properties of the Definite Integral   Let be integrable functions on . Then    If on , then .

We can do this as follows.  Let be some function continuous on . Then we can say that must be continuous on every interval of the form for in . This means that the definite integrals exist, and so we can use these to define a function, say .   Functions from integrals   Let and define . Find . Where is the largest?    First, note that we can compute by finding an antiderivative of . So or just   We can find where is largest by using a derivative test or just geometry. Since represents the area under from to , it follows that this area will be largest at , since this is where crosses the axis.    There's one important thing to take away from the previous example. The function turned out to be an antiderivative of , so in particular . This is not a coincidence.   Fundamental Theorem of Calculus   Let be a continuous function defined on .   Define for in . Then , i.e., is an antiderivative of .  Let be a particular antiderivative of . Then     We'll sketch the proof of the first part. First, assume that . Then Now, if is small and if , then should be approximately equal to since is continuous. Therefore and so .    The second part of is something we've seen before in , but the first part is new. Essentially, this result says that integration and differentiation are inverses of each other.   Error function   The error function , defined by is one of the most important functions in statistics and other applications of mathematics (such as modeling the spread of a virus or the spread of heat). Find the derivative of .    By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we have Note that as , which suggests that the error function \"levels out\" as increases, which is in fact true.

First, we need to figure out the cost per month due to depreciation and maintenance, call it . Then Now, the total depreciation after months is , and the total maintenance cost after months is . So This is the function we need to minimize.  To minimize , we'll start by finding its critical points. Assuming that each of these functions is differentiable, we have which reduces to So the critical points occur at any value for which , i.e., the cost per month due to depreciation and maintenance equals the rate of depreciation plus the rate of maintenance costs.  Now we need to see if we have a minimum or a maximum. To do so, we can use the second derivative test. After some algebra, we get that and so Therefore gives a local minimum. If we assume that is differentiable everywhere, then this local minimum should also be an absolute minimum since it's the only critical point.    "

To see how the chain rule leads to an integration rule, suppose we have an expression where are differentiable. Then the chain rule says that Now, write and make the substitution .

This can't be simplified using algebra (since integrals don't split up over products!) and substitution probably won't be very helpful, since does not already contain an \"inside function\" that we could replace. The integration tools that we have are unable to compute this integral, so we need to develop more tools!  Recall that the substitution method for solving integrals from is derived from the chain rule. In fact, by every derivative rule available to us also provides a corresponding integration rule. So perhaps the integration rule corresponding to the product rule can help us to integrate products. We call this method integration by parts .   Integration by Parts  integration techniques integration by parts   Let and be continuous functions, with differentiable. Then     By the product rule, we have . Rearranging this, we have Finally, we can integrate both sides to get     A useful way to remember the integration by parts method is as follows: Integration by parts can be used to integrate products of functions that can't already be evaluated by simpler means .   Using the Integration by Parts Formula   Compute .    To use , we need to write in the form . Once we have and , then we can set up the rest of the formula. One thing that can make this method tricky is the fact that we can have many different choices for and ; the only thing we need for certain is for here.

Since gets simpler if we differentiate it by doesn't, this suggests that we should set . And since , we must have (since automatically becomes whatever is left over). With these choices, we have   Therefore      You may be wondering why we didn't include an arbitrary constant when we found in . This is because including an arbitrary constant here doesn't affect the final answer. It's certainly not incorrect to include one here, but it adds more work than is already necessary.   When using the integration by parts method, it's usually a good idea to choose to be the polynomial portion of your integrand if there is one. This is because polynomials become simpler when they're differentiated. However, there are examples where should be something else.   Integrals Involving the Natural Logarithm   Determine .    Since we need to integrate a product, and we can't easily do so with -substitution or algebra, we'll try integration by parts. We could pick , and this is certainly easy to differentiate so we can find . However, doing so leaves us with , which is tricky to integrate, but is easy to differentiate. So we'll try setting and . Then   and so      An Integral from Differential Equations   An important concept in the field of differential equations is that of the Laplace transform . In the process of computing the Laplace transform of , an integral similar to appears. Determine this integral.    Here, it doesn't make much difference what we select for or , since both and are easy to differentiate and integrate, while neither becomes simpler. But since we're integrating a product, we'll try to use integration by parts anyway and hope for the best. To that end, let and . Then and , which gives   As expected, the new integral isn't any simpler than the one that we started with. However, it's not any more complicated either. So we'll try integration by parts on the new integral as well, with and . Then   So we have   There is something very strange about this equation: the same integral appears on both sides . This is no longer a calculus problem, it's an algebra problem! Solving for the integral algebraically (and including the arbitrary constant!) gives     Integrals with integrands of the form , or (where is a polynomials) can be successfully evaluated using the tabular method .   The Tabular Method   Evaluate .    Integration by parts also applies to definite integrals. You only need to remember to carry the limits through.   Sign of a Sine   Let .

  "body": " Trigonometric Integrals and Substitution   In this section we determine how to evaluate integrals involving powers of trigonometric functions (such as , and others), as well as integrals involving certain radicals. Much of our work will follow from the important identity , as well as the half-angle formulas      Integrals Involving Powers of Sine and Cosine   Integrating an Odd Power of Cosine   Determine .    Although it's not obvious, we can actually solve this integral with substitution. First, we'll separate a power of from the rest in order to act as our : Now, if we want to act as in a substitution, then we need to look like . We can do this by using the Pythagorean Identity and writing .  Now we'll set , which gives and   which we can finish integrating without much trouble.    The trick we used above only worked because we had an odd power of cosine. In general, when integrating , you want to separate a factor from an odd power (if there is one). Then finish by using substitution.   Odd Powers of Sine and Cosine   Determine .    Remember: we want to separate a factor off of an odd power if there is one. Thankfully, we have two! We'll pick sine this time:   At this point, the integral isn't too difficult to complete.    If integrating even powers of sine and cosine, the algebra gets a little worse since the substitution trick applied above no longer works.   Integrating Even Powers of Cosine   The integral appears when finding the area of the circle using integration. Find the value of this integral.    Since we have an even power to work with, we'll try the half-angle formula. This lets us reduce the power on the cosine, at the expense of multiplying by , which greatly works in our favor:     Trying to evaluate integrals of higher even powers of sine and cosine quickly becomes tedious and is a job best left to computer algebra systems (like Sage).   Using Sage to Simplify Half-Angle Expansion   Evaluate .    We will need to use the half-angle identity for cosine three times before we can integrate. To help us do this we will make use of the .trig_reduce() method in Sage:   We can integrate this without too much trouble now (or even let Sage do the integral for us!).      Integrals Involving Powers of Secant and Tangent  In contrast to those involving sine and cosine, all of the integrals here involving secant and tangent are solvable using substitution. Generally, we'll attack these problems by separating a factor of (in which case we use ) or a factor of (in which case we use ). This will often be done using the Pythagorean identity  We will occasionally need to make use of two integral formulas:    Integrating a Power of Tangent   Determine .    Our goal is to separate a factor of either or to serve as our . Since neither appears, we'll use the Pythagorean identity to introduce a into our integral:   At this point the first integral can be solved using substitution, but the second integral needs to be rewritten again. However, the same trick we applied before works here too: just use the Pythagorean identity to introduce a factor of . This gives So      Integrating a Product of Tangent and Secant   Determine     Here, we see that we can separate a factor of from the integrand, so we'll do that and use :     In general, try to follow the guidelines below when integrating products of secant and tangent:  If the power of secant is even , then separate a factor of and use , along with the Pythagorean identity if necessary.  If the power of tangent is odd , then separate a factor of and use , along with the Pythagorean identity if necessary.    Now, for an example that does not fall into the above guidelines.   Integrating Secant Cubed   Determine .    We're dealing with an odd power of secant, so splitting off a factor of won't help here. We also lack a term, so splitting off a factor of is tricky as well. We'll try integrating by parts instead, with This gives   Therefore       Trigonometric Substitutions  An ellipse with horizontal axis length and vertical axis length centered at the origin is given by If we want to find the area of this ellipse, then we can compute the following integral and multiply it by : This integral is difficult to solve due to the square root in the integrand; it's tough to imagine what an antiderivative might be. So what we'll try to do is to use a \"reverse substitution\" that simplifies the square root.  To do so, notice that the Pythagorean identity gives . Taking the square root of the left hand side is much easier here than taking a root of the right hand side. So we'll try that substitution here: let Then Before we go further, let's figure out what our new limits are. Since , we have , and so . Hence we need our limits for to be and , and so we get We've seen how to integrate a function like this in .

Now we'll move on to a tool that will help us integrate rational functions (quotients of polynomials). The idea behind this method is to write a rational function, such as , in terms of simpler fractions. We'll demonstrate by example.   Integrating a Rational Function   Let Find .    We could try secant substitution, but that we'll instead focus on simplifying this fraction. First, factor the denominator:   Now, assume that we can find constants such that If we could find such constants, we could integrate the right hand side instead of the left hand side. There are a few ways to find these constants, but the easiest might be to just clear fractions by multiplying both sides by :   So need to satisfy this equation for all possible values of  . We'll pick values for that make it easy to find and . If , then becomes Similarly, Therefore     Finding partial fraction decompositions as in isn't too bad as long as the denominator can be factored into distinct (i.e. non-repeated) linear factors . The situation is more complicated if the factors are repeated or are quadratics (or both).   Finding a Partial Fraction Decomposition with Repeated Powers   Find the partial fraction decomposition for .    Since , it's tempting to write Unfortunately, doing so gives , which obviously won't work. If we instead use we get . However,   What we need to do is assume If we don't account for each power, we're not guaranteed a partial fraction decomposition. Now let's clear fractions: Quickly, using we find that , and using we find that .  At this point there are no nice values left to plug into the right hand side of , so we need to find and another way. One possibility is to differentiate both sides to make the right hand side simpler, which gives Now, entering into gives and so . Similarly, . Therefore     In order to find partial fraction decompositions when the denominator contains a quadratic, we must allow for the possibility of the numerator being linear .   Partial Fraction Decomposition with a Quadratic   Determine     First, we can simplify: Now that we've factored the denominator, we can attempt to find the partial fraction decomposition. So assume that Note the linear term above the quadratic!  The rest of this computation goes like it did before. If we clear fractions, we get If we plug in , we obtain . At this point, we could plug in (which would be okay!) or differentiate both sides, but it might be easier to take the following approach: expand the right hand side and collect like terms to get   For the right hand side to equal the left hand side,  must be zero . Hence . Similarly,  must equal one . Therefore     Comparing like terms as in is a useful technique even beyond partial fractions.  The method of partial fractions works as long as the degree of the numerator is strictly less than that of the denominator.    Partial Fractions Algorithm  partial fractions algorithm   To find the partial fraction decomposition for the rational function , do the following:  Simplify as much as possible, using long division if necessary when .

Find the unknown constants of the decomposition by plugging values for that simplify the equation, differentiating both sides, and\/or comparing like terms.       Using Long Division   Determine .    Before setting up partial fractions, we should simplify the integrand as much as possible. Here, we can use long division since the degree of the numerator is greater than or equal to the degree of the denominator. Doing so, we get We can integrate the first two terms on the right hand side easily, but we'll use partial fractions to rewrite the fraction:   Now clear fractions to get Setting gives , and setting gives . To find , we can expand the right hand side to write Hence .  Therefore     The next example shows a substitution that may occasionally work when partial fractions fails.   Twisty Substitution   Determine     Once again we have a radical causing problems, and it's not in any of the three trigonometric substitution forms we can use either. We want it to go away, so we'll try just that: set , which gives . Then Now, we use the fact that to write which simplifies to     The computation of partial fraction decompositions can be greatly simplified with Sage. This can be done by using the partial_fraction() method. For example, the partial fraction decomposition of is determined by Sage to be as follows:   Sage can also handle fractions that require long division as in the next example.

  "title": "Improper Integrals",
  "body": " Improper Integrals   (Note: this section corresponds to Section 6.6 of the text.) Consider the following problem: determine the smallest velocity required for an object to escape the earth's gravitational pull (i.e., the escape velocity ). We can try to answer this problem by looking at the total work needed to move this object. From one viewpoint, work is just the total change in kinetic energy. If the object is moving at escape velocity, say , then all of its kinetic energy must have been converted into work: , where is the mass of the object.  As we'll see later, work is also the integral of force, so let's examine the force on the object. If we neglect air resistance and assume that the only force acting on the object is gravity, then the force exerted on the object is given by where is the mass of the Earth, is still the mass of the object, is the distance from the center of mass of the Earth to the center of mass of the object, and is the gravitational constant. Now assume that the Earth is a sphere of radius , and that the object has enough velocity to move it a distance of units from the surface of the Earth. Then the total work done in moving the object this distance is Now let's think about should happen if the object is at escape velocity. In this case, theoretically at least, there should be no limit to the distance the object can travel if given enough time. So what's the total work done?  Let's try to compute We get Note that this is still an underestimate for the total work theoretically done, since can increase without bound. So let's send to and see what we get:   So, to summarize, the total work should be or just  We can solve this equation for , and so the escape velocity should be As a neat bonus, this shows that the escape velocity only depends on , the mass of the Earth and the \"radius\" of the Earth . Plugging in values for these figures, we get meters per second, or kilometers per second.  This is all very important obviously, but this is calculus, and what we really care about are the mathematical tools required to solve this problem. To do this, we basically had to figure out what the integral of was over the interval . This is our first example of an improper integral .    Improper Integrals over Infinite Intervals  First, a definition.   Type 1 Improper Integral   Let be some function, and let be a constant. If exists for every , then we define assuming this limit exists. Similarly, if exists for every , then we define assuming this limit exists. These improper integrals are convergent if the corresponding limits exist and divergent otherwise.  Finally, if both and are convergent, then we define      A Divergent Integral   Determine if is convergent or divergent.    By definition, we have Hence the integral is divergent.    In , note that as . However, it doesn't go to  fast enough for the integral to converge.    Is convergent?    The convergence of depends on the value of .   Integral -test   The integral converges if and only if .     Area Under a Graph   Find the area under .    The area under is given by . To evaluate this integral, we must split it into two improper integrals:   At this point, we can use -substitution to find each integral, using and . So we get   Hence the area under is (which might not be so surprising if you graph ).     Radioactive Decay   A radioactive substance undergoes decay, and has mass at time given by for some . The expected lifetime of a particle is given by Find this value.    We can solve this using integration by parts. Doing so, we get This can be verified using the code cell below.       A Probability Distribution   In probability, a probability distribution is a function satisfying . Is a probability distribution?    We have . So this isn't a probability distribution.     Another Laplace Transform   The Laplace transform of a function is defined to be , assuming is chosen so that the integral converges. Find the Laplace transform of .     Improper Integrals with Discontinuous Integrands  The second type of improper integral we'll consider involves integrands with \"divide-by-zero\" problems.   Type 2 Improper Integral   If is continuous on and is discontinuous at , then assuming this limit exists.  If is continuous on and is discontinuous at , then assuming this limit exists.  If is at where , then assuming these integrals are convergent.     Logarithmic Discontinuity   Determine if is convergent.    This integral is improper since is discontinuous at . To evaluate it, we'll use limits: where we used the fact that as by L'Hopital's Rule.     Another Integral -Test   For what values of is the integral convergent?    We could try to compute this as is, but we can save ourselves some work by making use of . First, we'll use the substitution . Then and Therefore which we know converges if and only if . Hence the original integral converges if and only if .      Comparison Tests for Improper Integrals  For integrals, we have two comparison tests that allow us to determine if an improper integral converges by comparing it with a simpler integral. First, we'll look at the direct comparison test .   convergence tests integrals direct comparison test  Direct Comparison Test   Suppose that and are continuous functions and that for , for some real number . Then if converges, so goes . Likewise, if diverges, then so does .      Does converge?    This integrand looks pretty awful. However, we can say that Since  implies that the original integral must converge as well. Note that we don't know what it converges to, only that it does.     The Gaussian Integral   Show that the integral is convergent.    We can do this by breaking the integral into two parts: If is between and , then . On the other hand, if , then . Therefore Hence the original integral must also be convergent. It's value is actually known (see ), and Sage can also be used to compute its value as below.     To use successfully, we need to choose a simpler function that's related to the integrand and then use algebra to justify a specific inequality.

To generate the solid of revolution on the right, we take the graph of and rotate it about the -axis, creating a three-dimensional region.           Generating a solid of revolution.   To find the volume of such a region, the idea is to find the area of a general cross-section of the region, which by design should be a function of alone, say . Then, roughly, should represent the volume of a small cross-section of the solid, and so the integral should give us the volume of the region. This entire argument can be made precise using Riemann sums as in the previous section, and so we get the following: the solid from to whose cross-sections (with respect to the -axis) have area has volume given by    Finding the Volume of a Sphere   Find the volume of a sphere of radius .

Given between and , the area of the corresponding cross-section is given by Hence the volume of this region should be     The previous problems involved finding volumes by using disks since disks were natural cross-sections. The next example instead uses washers as cross-sections instead.

In this section, we'll look at using cylindrical shells instead.  Therefore, the following fact will prove useful: the volume of a cylindrical shell of height , inner radius and outer radius is given by where is the \"average radius\" and is the thickness of the shell. If we can break a solid up into these cylindrical \"cross-sections,\" then integrating these areas should again give us the volume of the solid.

When finding volumes using shells, we'll typically use shells that are parallel to the axis of rotation.    One final note: this method, as in , applies only to solids with a certain degree of symmetry. If you continue on to Calculus 3, the techniques you'll learn in will replace this method as they do the disk and washer methods from .

  "title": "Applications to Physics and Engineering",
  "body": " Applications to Physics and Engineering   The primary use of integrals in physics and engineering is to measure the accumulation of continuously varying quantities. The running theme in this section:   Measure the accumulation of some quantity by approximating it as a (finite) sum of \"small\" values.  Improve the approximation by taking more and more values.  Introduce a limit to make the approximation exact, resulting in an integral.     Work  We introduced a formula for work in , and now we'll actually derive it. First, recall that work (very roughly) represents the net effect of a force  acting on a mass over some displacement . If the force is constant (in both magnitude and direction), then we can simply define the work accomplished by a force as a particle is displaced by units by the formula   So with this definition, work is proportional to the magnitude of the force as well as the displacement over which the force acts. If is measured in units of    or more simply   , and is measured in units of   the takes on units of    or just   .  Although there are important forces that are reasonably approximated by constants, such as the force due to gravity, this isn't reasonable for every force of interest. For example, consider the force due to drag against an object moving through the atmosphere, which should increase as velocity increases. Another basic example is the Hooke's Law , which states that the force a spring exerts on an attached mass is proportional to the displacement of the mass from the spring's equilibrium position. For these non-constant forces, our old formula doesn't work so well. To be precise, how can we measure the work done by a non-constant force on a particle as it moves from to ?  As you might guess from this section's running theme, we'll start by approximating the work done by measuring work in small displacements as the particle moves from to . Over small enough intervals, even variable forces will look almost constant, which makes a reasonable estimate of the work done (on this small interval!). So let's start by breaking up into smaller subintervals where , and let be the width of each subinterval. Now choose sample points from each subinterval. Once again, if is small enough, then the work done by the force over should be approximately   This is the approximate work for one subinterval, so adding in the approximations from the other subintervals also provides an estimate of the total work done by over . That is, As , the approximation becomes exact. Therefore    A mass attached to a spring   A mass attached to a spring is acted upon by a spring force given by , where is the displacement of the mass from the equilibrium position of the spring. Suppose that the mass is held  1   to the right of the spring's equilibrium position (so that the spring will try to pull the mass back towards its equilibrium which we'll say occurs at ). What is the work done by the spring on the mass in moving the mass from its current position back to equilibrium?    Since equilibrium occurs at , the work done should be     In , the reason the work done was positive was because the force and the direction the mass was moving tended to align. Once the mass moves past equilibrium and to the left, the force will begin acting against the motion of the mass resulting in negative work over that particular interval. The spring force itself is an example of a restoring force , since it's always trying to pull the mass back to equilibrium. To highlight this, we often write the spring force as for some positive .    Moments and Centers of Mass  Consider a system of two point masses connected by a rod of negligible mass (so we can assume that the mass of the system is just ). These masses are located at the points on the -axis. The rod is then placed upon a fulcrum at the point , as shown below:      Rod on a fulcrum.   Our goal is to find the center of mass of the rod.  Suppose that the first mass is units away from the fulcrum, and that the second mass is units away. Archimedes' Law of the Lever states that the rod will balance if . Since and (since are positive!), we can rewrite this as which simplifies down to Hence is the location of the center of mass of the rod if this equation is true!  More generally, if point masses at position are connected by a rod of negligible mass, then the center of mass of the resulting system is given by where is the total mass of the system and is called the moment of the system about the origin .    Consider the following system of three point masses at positions given as follows:      Three point masses.   Find the following:  The moment of the system about the origin.  The center of mass.       The moment of the system about the origin is defined to be So the moment is .  The center of mass is just the moment divided by the total mass of the system: So the center of mass of the rod is at the point .     We now move from one dimension to two. Consider a system of point masses at the points , and suppose that these masses are connected by a thin plate of negligible mass. The moment of the system about the -axis is the number given by   This can be thought of as tendency of the system to rotate about the -axis. Increasing the mass or the distance from the -axis increases this tendency.  The moment of the system about the -axis is the number given by Just as in the one-dimensional case, the center of mass for this system will be determined by the total mass and the above moments. In particular, the center of mass of this system is located at the point with coordinates where is the total mass .    Four point masses are located in the plane at the points and .  Find the moments of the system about the -axis and the -axis.  Find the center of mass of this system.       The moment about the -axis is  Similarly, the moment about the -axis is given by  The center of mass is the point where and is the total mass of the system.    } We now consider a more complicated situation than the above. Suppose that we have a thin, flat plate (or lamina ) of uniform density in the plane. Our goal now is to find the center of mass, or centroid , of the plate. To do so, we will use the following fact: the centroid of a rectangular lamina of uniform density is just the center of the rectangle. Now consider a lamina with uniform density in the -plane and bounded between and the functions and :      A lamina in .   To find the centroid of this lamina we will break it up into (vertical) approximating rectangles , each of which has width and centroid :      Breaking the lamina into subrectangles.   Then the lamina may be approximated by a system of point masses , with located at the centroid rectangle and having the mass of the corresponding rectangle. To find the center of mass of the lamina, we will approximate it with the center of mass of the system of point masses.  To do so, we will need:   Consider a single rectangle :      A single rectangle.   Then we have   We can now fill in the following table:   Moments and center of mass     System of point masses  Lamina                    The center of mass for this lamina is then the point where    Finding the centroid of a region contained by parabolas   Let denote the region in the -plane contained by and . Find the centroid of .    We begin by plotting the region , which is given in   A parabolic lamina in    A graph displaying a lamina bounded by two parabolic curves. The lamina is called .      The -coordinate of the centroid is given by the formula in , but life is a bit easier for us if we make use of the symmetry of this region about the -axis as evidenced by . This symmetry forces and so we just need to find by using .  To this end, we set up the appropriate integrals using and : . Both integrals can be found by using a bit of algebra and the power rule, or by using Sage as well:   Therefore the center of mass of the lamina must be located at the point .   Note that we also could have used a symmetry argument to find .      "

  "body": " Differential Equations   Basic Concepts   Differential Equations  differential equations definition   A differential equation is an equation relating some function with its derivatives. A differential equation that involves a function of only one independent variable is called an ordinary differential equation , or ODE. A differential equation that involves a function of more than one independent variable (which you see a lot of in Calculus 3) is called a partial differential equation , or PDE. The order of a differential equation is the highest derivative that appears in the equation.    Examples of ODEs:   ; this is a second order ODE relating the unknown function with its second derivative.   ; this is a seventh order ODE involving the derivatives of the unknown function . Note that in this ODE is the independent variable whereas serves as the dependent variable.    Differential equations serve as useful mathematical models for quantities that change over time. In particular, Newton's Second Law leads to a number of significant differential equations.   The Spring Equation   Consider an object of mass attached to a spring, and suppose that the spring force is the only force acting on the mass. Assuming that Hooke's Law describes the spring force, find a differential equation modeling the motion of the mass.    Recall that Hooke's Law says that , where is a positive constant and is the displacement of the mass from equilibrium. If this is the only force acting on the mass, then by Newton's Second Law Therefore the displacement satisfies the differential equation      Solution of a Differential Equation  differential equations solution   A function is a solution of a differential equation if it satisfies the differential equation.    It is straightforward to check if a function is a solution of some given differential equation, but finding solutions involves a bit more work.   Verifying solutions   Is a solution of the ODE ?    At this point we don't know how to solve differential equations, but that doesn't mean we can't check solutions of differential equations. To do so, we just plug wherever shows up in the ODE and see if the resulting equation is true. So we have This is a true statement, so satisfies the ODE. Hence is a solution of the ODE.    In , is not the only solution of . You can check that and are also solutions. In fact, any function of the form where is a constant is a solution of .  To specify a unique solution to a differential equation, we need to add another condition known as an initial condition or initial value , often of the form .    An ODE together with an initial condition is known as an initial value problem , or IVP.      Separable Equations  Many ODEs are difficult, if not impossible, to solve exactly. The simplest ODEs to solve are the first-order ODEs of the form . The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus guarantees that the solution is given by .  Another type of ODE that is relatively straightforward to solve is the separable ODE , which is a first-order ODE that can be written in the form . These ODEs can be solved by integration as well, but only after some rearranging.   Solving a separable ODE involving arctangent   Solve the IVP given by .    The first step to solving this IVP is to solve the ODE . It may not look like it at first, but this ODE is separable since we can rewrite it as . To solve this ODE, we need to move the terms to the left hand side of the equation and the terms to the right hand side. We'll abuse notation a little bit to do so by rewriting and treating as a fraction, but it won't get us into too much trouble here: .  At this step we can either leave the solution as is (in implicit form ) or solve for to get an explicit form . We'll leave this in implicit form and then plug in the initial condition to get So the implicit solution of this IVP is given by   We can also find an explicit form of the solution by solving for :     Note that we can also make use of Sage's desolve command to find the solution of this IVP. We will need to specify the initial condition by using the ics argument:      Finding an explicit solution of a separable ODE   Find the explicit solution of the ODE given by . Assume that .    Note that our solution will be of the form . To find it, we will separate variables and then integrate: .  At this point we have an implicit solution of our ODE, and we just need to solve for to get the explicit solution. We do so by eliminating the natural logarithm and then rearranging: .   Note that if this were an IVP, it would be easiest to find the value of the arbitrary constant immediately after integrating.     It is occasionally difficult to determine if an ODE of the form is separable or not. Thankfully, there is an algebraic method available that determines whether or not an ODE is separable and, if so, provides a factorization. This method works by first finding some point such that . Then we define . If then the ODE is separable and provides a factorization of . If then the equation is not separable.   Determining Separability of an ODE   Determine if the ODE given by is separable.    Let and note that . Using , define . It can be checked that and so the equation is separable.  The solution of this differential equation can now be found using the methods of this section. In particular, using Sage and the desolve command we get the following:   With a little bit of work, we can also convince Sage to turn this implicit solution into an explicit solution by solving for . The heavy lifting here is done by the .log_simplify() and .solve() methods. In order to help Sage with simplifying the logarithms, we will clear fractions first. This prevents any radicals from appearing inside of the logarithms after simplification and makes solving for easier:   Therefore the explicit solution of our equation is .      Population Equations  Suppose we're monitoring the population of some species, and let's denote the population at time by . An obvious question to consider is how that population will change over time. Mathematically, this means we want to obtain information on and then use it to estimate .  A simple model for is to assume it depends only on the birth rate and death rate of the species in question. Then we can write If we assume that are constants, then this equation is separable and we can solve it to obtain where represents the \"initial population\", or population at time . We call the natural growth equation .  The natural growth equation is simple, but it's probably too simple to be useful expect in certain scenarios (such as measuring half-life). To get a more flexible model, we can generalize by assuming that the birth and death rates are actually functions of time. This gives us the general population equation .   General Population Equation  population models general population equation   The general population equation for a population is given by      Population Explosion   A population has members at time years with a death rate of and a birth rate of , where denotes the population after years. Find and determine if this is a reasonable population model.    If we assume that the population obeys the general growth equation, then we get This ODE is separable, and we can therefore solve it to get   So we have a solution, and it can be shown that the solution is unique. But if you stare at this for a bit, you might see that it has a divide-by-zero problem. In particular, In other words, the population becomes infinite in about two weeks!      The Logistic Equation   shows that we need to be more careful with our assumptions on population growth. One relatively simple assumption we can make is to assume that the birth rate decreases as population increases. This makes sense in the physical world as well: as population increases, existing and finite resources (such as food) must be shared between more and more members of the population. Since there's less to go around, we should expect growth to slow down. In particular, let's assume that where and are all positive constants. Then the population equation for this scenario becomes .  With a little algebra, we get the logistic equation : where and are constants (but not arbitrary constants!). This equation is separable, and can be solved using partial fractions to obtain , where . In order to verify the reasonableness of our logistic model, let's see what happens to the population as time increases.   Alternate form of the logistic equation  Since the constant affects the growth or decay of a logistic population, the logistic equation is sometimes written in the following form: .    Long-Term Behavior of Logistic Growth   What is the long-term population of a species that grows according to ?    Using the fact that we have So the population should eventually level out at .    In , the value is the carrying capacity , and denotes the maximum sustainable population predicted by the model. Populations that start between and will grow towards and populations that start above will shrink towards .   Population growth in the USA   In millions, the population of the USA in 2010 was and was growing at a rate of per year. In 2020, the population was and was growing at a rate of per year. Assuming that the population of the USA grows logistically, estimate the population of the USA in 2023 and compare it to the current estimate of .    Let denote the population of the USA (in millions), where is the number of years after 2010. Then and So we need to find and .  When , we have and . Similarly, when we have and . Therefore . We need to solve this system to find and so we can finish setting up our model. This is easily accomplished with Sage's solve command:   Therefore . We can now plug these values into to get . Our population estimate in the year is then This has a relative error of about .      Stability of Solutions  The logistic equation is a particularly nice separable ODE since the right hand side depends only on the unknown function . So we can write , where . ODEs like this (where the independent variable does not appear explicitly) are called autonomous ODEs .  Autonomous ODEs like are useful because the behavior of their solutions can be determined qualitatively , without actually solving the ODE. This is done by looking for the constant solutions of the ODE, that is, solutions of the form . For any such solution, we must have as well. These solutions (i.e., the solutions of ) are called the critical points or equilibrium solutions of the ODE. These solutions completely determine the long-term behavior of every other solution .   Finding Equilibrium Solutions   Find the equilibrium solutions of .    We need to solve the equation . Thankfully, we can factor this to get , and so the equilibrium solutions are .     Stability of Solutions   A critical point is stable if solutions that start \"near\" the point stay near it. A critical point is unstable if solutions that start \"near\" the point can diverge away from it.     Determining the Stability of Solutions   What are the stable critical points of ?    We already know that the critical points are . We can determine their stability by making use of a phase diagram , which is essentially a sign chart for :   The phase diagram for      This shows us that solutions that begin near tend to move away from , which solutions near tend to move towards . So is unstable and is stable.    We can also determine phase diagrams graphically. For instance, consider the phase diagram depicted in . The direction of each arrow is determined by the sign of the derivative , i.e., the sign of . This is easily determined by just graphing on the phase diagram like so:   Constructing a phase diagram using the graph of       Determining a Sustainable Population   Consider a population of fish that obeys the logistic equation where is the population of fish (in thousands) after years. Suppose that the population is also harvested at some rate (in thousands per year). What is the maximum sustainable rate of harvesting?    To account for the harvesting, we need to modify the ODE: The harvesting will be sustainable as long as the population does not become extinct. To determine this long term behavior, we'll find the critical points and set up a phase diagram.  The critical points are given by by the quadratic formula. We now have three cases to consider: In terms of , these reduce to .    In the first case, if then we have two positive, real critical points: The phase diagram for this situation is      Phase diagram for .   So we see that is unstable while is stable. In particular, as long as , then the rate of harvesting is sustainable.    Now assume that . Then we have only one equilibrium solution: . The corresponding phase diagram is      Phase diagram for = 450.   We interpret the phase diagram as follows: if is less than 15,000 then the population will collapse to extinction. Otherwise, the population will stabilize at . This type of critical point is often called semi-stable.     Finally, consider the case . Then we have no (real) critical points. Since imaginary populations don't make sense in this model, there is no sustainable population. No matter how large the initial population, it will eventually go extinct if harvested at a rate greater than .    By the above, the largest sustainable harvesting rate is as long as .      Linear Stability Analysis  Given the autonomous ODE , we saw above that we can qualify the behavior of equilibrium solutions by setting up a phase diagram. We can go a step further and actually qualify the growth of solutions that are \"near\" equilibrium solutions. In particular, we have the following theorem.   Linear Stability Analysis   Suppose where is continuously differentiable, and let denote a critical point\/equilibrium solution of the ODE. If , then is stable and solutions near will move exponentially towards . If , then is unstable and solutions near will move exponentially away from . If , then more advanced methods are required.     Classifying the Critical Points of the Logistic Equation   Classify the critical points of the logistic equation as stable or unstable.    Recall that the logistic equation is given by for (we'll assume) positive constants . From here, we clearly see that the critical points are and (which makes sense from a population standpoint!). We could set up a phase diagram to determine stability, but we'll use instead.  Since , we see that Hence is unstable, while is stable.     "

In order to make sense of these series, we need to introduce the concept of a sequence and the limit of a sequence.  A sequence is a list of numbers: often written . We will often take as our starting index, but not always. We call the term of the sequence, and itself the index . We can view as denoting the position of the number within the sequence.   Finding a Formula for a Sequence   Given the sequence , make a reasonable guess of the value of and the general formula for .    Sequences are usually specified in one of two ways: as an explicit formula such as , or recursively by means of a recurrence relation , such as Note that for recurrence relations, we need to specify base cases .   An Alternating Sequence   Find the first few terms of the sequence .    This sequence simplifies down to .    Sequences have limits just as functions do.   Limit of a Sequence   A sequence has limit , denoted , if gets arbitrarily close to as increases. If a sequence has a limit, we say the sequence is convergent and converges . Otherwise, we say the sequence is divergent and diverges .    Graphically, we can say that a sequence has a limit if the points become arbitrarily close to the line : If you run the above code cell, you get some pretty convincing evidence that as .  One of the most important sequential limits is the following: if . Many limits involving sequences with terms that are rational functions of can be reduced to this form when finding limits.    Find the limit of the sequence     We can try dividing the numerator and denominator by the highest power of that appears: . This gives . Now we can take the limit as to get .    We can also apply Calculus 1 limits to sequences by using the following theorem.   Sequential and Functional Limits   Let be a function and suppose that . Then also.    One immediate advantage of is that L'Hospital's Rule from applies to sequential limits as well, as long as the sequence consists of values from a differentiable function .   Finding a Sequential Limit Using L'Hospital's Rule   Let . Find .    First, note that where . Therefore  .    Geometric Sequences   A geometric sequence is a sequence of the form Find .    This limit depends on whether or not is in . If then . If then for all . Finally, if is outside of this interval, then diverges. Therefore and diverges otherwise.    May decimals can be represented using geometric sequences.   Repeating   Determine the limit of the sequence .    It looks like the terms of the sequence are approaching , and we can verify this using a geometric sequence. We can write this sequence as . So the limit of the sequence is . Note that this suggests the (true!) statement that .     Infinite Limits   Let be a sequence. If the terms of grow without bound as increases, we say that . If the terms of decrease without bound as increases, we say that .     Limit of the Fibonacci Sequence   Let denote the term of the Fibonacci sequence. Determine . Estimate .    One approach to estimate the limit is to graph the ratio to see if it approaches a limiting value. A computer system can handle this easily. The values of appear to settle in quickly around .  The actual limiting value is , the golden ratio .       To calculate limits, we can use a version of the limit laws.   Sequential Limit Laws   Let and be sequences with and . Let be a constant. Then the following are true:             assuming .   if .   if is continuous at .     Another useful tool for evaluating limits of recursive sequences is the following result: if , then also.   A Limit from Newton's Method   Find the limit of the sequence .    First, assume . Then taking the limit of both sides of the recurrence relation gives . Solving for , we get , which simplifies to .     A False Limit   Find the limit of the sequence .    If we let and take the limit of both sides of the recurrence, we get or just . However, the actual terms of the sequence are given by , which is clearly divergent! The problem here is that we assumed a limit existed in the first place. This is not always valid . So we need to be careful.    We can check whether or not a sequence is convergent without actually finding a limit, at least in certain cases.   Absolute Value Test   Suppose that . Then as well.     The Squeeze Theorem for Sequences   Let and be sequences such that . If , then .     Applying the Squeeze Theorem and the Absolute Value Test   Let . Find .    This sequence is complicated, so we'll try comparing with simpler sequences instead. First, we'll take the absolute value to get rid of the term: . Now we'll use the fact that and to write . Since , this forces , and this , to converge to as well.    Another important way to check if a sequence converges is the Monotone Convergence Theorem  .   Monotone Sequences   Let be a sequence. Then is increasing if for all and decreasing if for all . In either case, we say that the sequence is monotone.    If we add one more condition to a monotone sequence, we get a convergent sequence.   Bounded Sequences   Let be a sequence. We say that is bounded if there exists some real number such that for all .     Monotone Convergence Theorem   Let be a bounded monotone sequence. Then converges.     Applying the MCT   Let denote the sequence Determine if the sequence converges and if so find its limit.    First, note that To show this converges, we'll use the MCT. To do so, we must show that the sequence is bounded and increasing. To show it's bounded, we'll guess that for some . Then , implying the claim. Now, , showing the sequence is increasing.

Or in particular, how can we actually make sense of , or represent it?  We can consider rewriting as follows: . So we can identify with the sequence and the series  .    Infinite Series  We now introduce the fundamental construction of this chapter.   Infinite Series   An infinite series is a sum of the form where is a sequence.    Infinite series are useful for representing (and computing) irrational numbers (which includes almost all numbers).   Guessing sums   Guess the sums of the following series:               We have the following:         For this last sum we have an issue: there's no sensible way to define this sum. We can say that or by grouping terms differently.       We can determine what the value of a series should be by using limits.   Partial Sums and Convergence   Given the series , we denote its  partial sum by . If the sequence is convergent and , then we say that the original series converges and . If the sequence of partial sums diverges, we say the original series diverges .    Using , we can say that the sum diverges, since its sequence of partial sums is . The same is true for the first series in , but the second series converges.   Determining Convergence of a Series   Does the series converge?    We'll look at the sequence of partial sums. We have and so on. It looks like the sequence of partial sums approaches , so we guess that the series equals the same.      Geometric Series  The series in , as well as the first two series in , are examples of an important series known as a geometric series .   Geometric Series   A series is a geometric series if for some constants and . Equivalently, the terms of the series form a geometric sequence (see ).    Geometric series are useful because it's straightforward to find their values. To see how, let be a geometric series and let denote the corresponding sequence of partial sums. Then which gives . We can solve this for to get .  At this point, we can find the limit of the partial sums using . Therefore converges to if and diverges otherwise.  As a quick example of this result, we can find the value of since this series is geometric. To do so, we must determine and for this sum. Since , we have and also. Hence the series sums to .   Computing a geometric series   Determine the value of if it exists.    Since this series contains terms being raised to the power, we suspect it may be geometric. If we write out the first several terms, we get , so at each step we're dividing by . This series is therefore a geometric series with and . Since , this series converges. The value of this series is .    We can also find and without writing out the first few terms of the series.   A divergent geometric series   Determine the value of .    We can rewrite the series as . This is a geometric series with . Since , the series diverges.     Evaluating   Prove that using geometric series.    First, we need to write as a geometric series. We can do so as follows: , and so we see that . This is a geometric series with and (and so is convergent!), and so .     Writing a decimal as a fraction   Rewrite the decimal as a fraction .    First, it's a mathematical fact that any repeating decimal can be written as a rational number so we know that we can actually write as a fraction. We'll do so by rewriting the decimal as a geometric series: , which is a geometric series with and . This series is also convergent, and has sum .      Telescoping Series  We can find exact values for geometric series since their partial sums simplify nicely. Another type of series that can be calculated (relatively) easily is the telescoping series , and for the same reason.   Telescoping Series  series telescoping   A telescoping series is a series that can be written in the form .    The partial sums of a telescoping series simplify quite a bit due to cancellation of successive terms. In particular, the partial sums look like . Hence the value of the series can be found by computing . We'll demonstrate by way of example.   Telescoping logarithms   Find .    If we write out the first few terms, we get so it looks like many of these terms cancel each other out. To be precise about this, we'll find the partial sums of this series and then consider their limit: , which goes to as . So the series diverges.    Not every series is quickly recognizable as a telescoping series. Occasionally, we need to do a bit of algebra first.   Recognizing a telescoping series   Find .    It's not obvious at all that the series is telescoping, even if we write out a few terms. However, if we try partial fractions on we obtain (see SageMath cell below) . So .  The partial sum is , and so . Hence .      Series, or rather the summation symbol , obey many of the same laws as integrals: they split over sums and we may pull constants out.

  "body": " The Divergence, Integral and Comparison Tests  Divergence, Integral and Comparison Tests   The Divergence Test proven in is our first example of a convergence test : a test that determines if a given series converges or diverges. In this section we'll also introduce two more such tests. It's important to remember that convergence tests usually cannot be used to evaluate a series . Their primary importance is to check if a given series converges.    The Divergence Test  A useful test for divergence of a series involves the long-term behavior of the terms of the series.   Divergence Test   Consider the series . If , then diverges.    We'll prove the contrapositive of this statement. That is, we'll show that if the series converges then the terms go to . So suppose converges and let denote the sequence of partial sums. Then which must go to since the partial sums converge.    Note that cannot be used to prove convergence , only divergence. For example, the terms of the harmonic series go to but the series itself diverges.   Using the Divergence Test   Determine if diverges.    Since (in fact, it doesn't exist at all), the series must diverge.      The Integral Test  The main idea behind the integral test is to relate the value of a series to the value of a certain (improper) integral. This is useful since integrals are often easier to compute than series.   Integral Test   Suppose that is a positive, decreasing function on and let . Then must both converge or both diverge.     It is important to note that the Integral Test is not typically useful in finding the value of a series. It can only be used to determine convergence.    Determining Convergence Using the Integral Test   Determine if the series converges or diverges.    We can use the Integral Test here since is positive and decreasing. If we define , then . Now we'll compute : . Since the integral converges, so does the series. In fact, the value of the series is .     The Alternating Harmonic Series   Explain why cannot be applied to the alternating harmonic series  .    Since is neither decreasing nor positive, the Integral Test doesn't apply here.    An important corollary to is that the integral -test from applies to series as well.   Series -Test   The series converges if and only if .      Comparison Tests  The next series is an important example of a divergent series. This is one of the earliest known examples of a divergent series in the history of mathematics and is particularly interesting since it diverges despite its terms getting arbitrarily small.   The harmonic series   Show that the harmonic series  is divergent.    The idea here is to compare this series with a simpler one that we know diverges. We'll do so by looking at a specific set of partial sums: and in general .  So it follows that . Hence the harmonic series is divergent.     convergence tests series direct comparison test  Comparison Test   Let and be series with positive terms. Then   If and converges, then so does .    If and diverges, then so does .        Using the Comparison Test   Show that diverges.    Sometimes using the Comparison Test requires a little ingenuity.   A Little Ingenuity   Show that converges.    A test that is sometimes more straightforward is the Limit Comparison Test .   convergence tests series limit comparison test  Limit Comparison Test   Suppose that and are both series with positive terms, and suppose exists. Then   if , then either both series converge or both series diverge.    if and converges, then so does .    if and diverges, then so does .       The quantity in can be thought of as the relative size of as compared to .   A Little Less Ingenuity   Show that converges.    We saw previously that , which suggests comparing the original series with the -series . If we let and , then we see that . By and , the original series converges.    The Limit Comparison Test works very well with series containing terms given by a ratio of powers, in conjunction with the -series Test.   Radical Powers of   Does converge or diverge?

The Alternating Harmonic Series is also a useful example to illustrate the following definitions.   Absolute and Conditional Convergence   A series is absolutely convergent if converges. A series is conditionally convergent if it converges but diverges.    The Alternating Harmonic Series is an example of a conditionally convergent series. There are two important consequences of :   Absolutely convergent series are also convergent series.    For conditionally convergent series, order matters .

Hence the original series is absolutely convergent, and so also convergent.      Ratio Test  Geometric series are among the easiest to sum and determine convergence for. So it's useful to try to compare an arbitrary series with a geometric series. The main idea is to look at the long-term behavior of ratios of consecutive terms.

  "body": " Power Series   Definition and Examples  A power series (centered at ) is a series of the form where is a variable. Note that for such a series, only nonnegative, integer powers of are permitted. The terms are called coefficients , and they determine all properties of the series.   A series with negative integer powers for is called a Laurent series . While these series have important uses, we will not study them.    Examples of Power Series   Determine which of the following are power series:               Power series can also be centered at other numbers. A power series centered at is a series of the form . As before, only nonnegative integer powers are allowed in the series.    Convergence of Power Series  An important concern about power series is to determine the set of values of for which the series will converge. These questions are usually answered using the Ratio Test or the Root Test in combination with other convergence tests.   Convergence of a power series using the Ratio Test   For what values of does the series converge?    We'll try the ratio test to check convergence of this series. Doing so, we get . So the series converges if and diverges if .  When , or , the Ratio Test fails and we need to use other methods to determine the convergence or the series at these points. We therefore consider convergence of the power series at these points on a case-by-case basis.  At , the series becomes , which diverges by the -series test . At , the series reduces to the alternating harmonic series which converges by . Therefore this series converges for all in the interval and diverges otherwise. This is demonstrated in the figure below, which shows the partial sums for various values of along with the curve that these sums are converging to.   Convergence of on the interval        In , the values of for which the series converged was an interval. It turns out that this will always be the case, and the resulting interval is known as the interval of convergence of the series. The radius of this interval is called the radius of convergence . In general, we have the following.   The term radius might seem unusual for describing a one-dimensional interval, but there are circles involved here. Power series are best described using complex numbers, and in that setting the radius of convergence describes an actual circle in the complex plane containing complex values at which the series converges.    Convergence of Power Series   Given a series , there exists such that the series converges on the interval . The largest such is the radius of convergence.    For most series we'll consider (i.e., those of the form ), we can find using the formula . Note the similarity between and !   Interval and Radius of Convergence   Find the interval and radius of convergence of the series given by .    We'll find the radius of convergence first using , which is given by . So the radius of convergence is infinite, implying that the interval of convergence is .     Interval of convergence for series of even powers   Find the interval of convergence for the series given by .    First, note that . We'll start by finding the radius of convergence of the series. We can use again, and we will, but we need to be careful since the series actually involves powers of instead of just .  To address this power mismatch, we'll make the substitution in our series to get , and now we can use with . This gives , and so the radius of convergence of the modified series is .  Now we convert back to the series that we started with. Since the radius of convergence of the modified series is , this means that it will converge as long as . In other words, our original series will converge if , or equivalently . Hence, the radius of convergence of is equal to .  Now that we have the radius of convergence, we (mostly) know the interval of convergence. In particular, the interval of convergence must have endpoints of and . We must check convergence at these endpoints individually as in . If we do so, we see that the series converges at both endpoints. Thus, the interval of convergence for this series is .    We will often use the Root Test instead of the Ratio Test for determining convergence of power series. This usually happens when the coefficients of the series do not involve factorials.   Interval and Radius of Convergence from Root Test   Determine the interval and radius of convergence of .    If we apply the Root Test to this series, we get . We need this to be less than , which gives , and so the series converges for all in . So the radius of convergence is .  Now we need to check the endpoints. At , the series becomes , which diverges by the -series test. At , the series becomes which converges by the alternating series test. Therefore the interval of convergence is .     "

Power Series from Geometric Series  In we found that the geometric series sums to as long as . We now apply this formula to obtain an important power series.   Power series from geometric series   Let . Then the domain of is and for in this interval we have .    Note that the equation is only valid where the series on the left converges. If we try to plug in into this equation and treat it as valid, we get , which is nonsense. That said, it is perfectly valid to replace with its power series representation in situations where .   Finding a power series representation   Find a power series representation for and state the interval over which it is valid.    We'll try to relate this to the series in : . This representation is valid for , or for in the interval .    We can find power series for many other rational functions now by basing them on . Partial fractions and completing the square are also helpful.   Finding power series by completing the square and partial fractions   Let . Find a series representation for in two different ways: first by completing the square, and next by using partial fractions.    If we complete the square in the denominator of , we get . At this point we can make use of to obtain , a power series representation of centered at . This series converges as long as or just . This convergence is demonstrated in the figure below.   Partial sums converging to      If we use partial fractions instead, we get a different result. First, we find the partial fraction decomposition of : . Next, we rewrite this into a form where we can apply :   This representation is valid where both component series converge. Since the first series converges for and the second converges for , the entire representation converges for . The figure below demonstrates the convergence of the corresponding partial sums to .   Partial sums converging to        We will occasionally need to work backwards as well from a given power series to identify its corresponding function. This is especially common when using power series to solve certain differential equations.   Finding a function with specified power series   Find the function with power series given by .    We will once again use . To do so, we need to rewrite the series into the form . This is not too difficult to do if we combine exponents: . This series is geometric and converges for . Using , we see that . Therefore the function we seek is .      Power Series and Calculus  One of the most useful properties of power series is that the fundamental calculus operations, differentiation and integration, are valid for power series within their intervals of convergence.   Differentiation and Integration of Power Series   Suppose the power series has radius of convergence , and let denote the series on the interval . Then is differentiable on and or in other words . Similarly, . Both of these series have radius of convergence .     shows that integrating and differentiating power series is as easy as integrating or differentiating powers of . However, we do need to be careful at the endpoints.   Power Series for the Logarithm   Find a power series representation of centered at and its interval of convergence.    Since , we can integrate the series for to get the series for the logarithm. Doing so, we get . The series on the right has radius of convergence and interval of convergence by . To find , we can substitute into the equation (which is valid!) to get . So , and . Plugging in , we get the series .    We can also use integrals and derivatives to identify given power series in terms of some function .   Using derivatives to evaluate a series   Find the function represented by .    This power series looks very much like a geometric series except for the factor of out front. We can deal with this by viewing the sum as the derivative of a geometric series. In particular, by .

  "body": " Taylor and Maclaurin Series  Taylor Series   In we found how to obtain power series using the geometric series. In this section we will determine how to find more general power series by means of Taylor polynomials and Taylor series .    Taylor Polynomials  Suppose that we are given a function that we want to approximate with a polynomial of degree , say , centered at some point . If is differentiable, then a natural condition to put on our polynomial approximation is for the derivatives to match up to the th-order derivative: .   This process of finding a polynomial that best approximates a function near a given point generalizes the concept of a linear approximation introduced in .   If we write , then we want to choose the coefficients in order to make the following system of equations true: . In other words, the coefficients of our polynomial must be given by for if we want the corresponding derivatives to match. This gives us the Taylor polynomial of order .   Taylor Polynomial of Order  Taylor polynomial of order    Taylor polynomial of order    Let be a function that is -times differentiable at (so that all exist). The corresponding Taylor polynomial of order centered at is given by .    Taylor polynomials are typically very good approximations to a given differentiable function near their center. However, the approximation usually gets worse as gets farther away from the center.   Taylor polynomial of   Compute for centered at .    Using , we need to find . This is straightforward to find since for all , and so .  The figure below compares with its Taylor polynomials of order and . As expected, the Taylor polynomials of higher order produce a better approximation to , at least near .   Taylor polynomials of        We will often choose the center of a Taylor polynomial to be , but as mentioned above (and evidenced in ) the resulting polynomials become worse approximations as we move away from the center. Therefore it is occasionally desirable to choose the center to be some other value, particularly if we are trying to compute an estimate of a function.   Using a Taylor polynomial for a numerical estimate   Estimate by setting up an appropriate Taylor polynomial.    We need to estimate at . Therefore, we will use a Taylor polynomial of order centered at .  To find for this function, we need to choose our coefficients based on the derivatives. Since , it follows that our Taylor polynomial is .  As shown in below, this Taylor polynomial is a very good fit for the graph of near . Therefore, . In fact, the approximation produced by this Taylor polynomial is within three billionths of the true value of .   Taylor polynomial of        Taylor polynomials are also sometimes useful for rewriting polynomials. This is demonstrated in the next example.   Partial fractions with Taylor polynomials   Find the partial fraction decomposition of .    The partial fraction decomposition of will take the form . We could find this using the methods discussed in , but this would be tedious. Instead, we'll use an appropriate Taylor polynomial to rewrite as a polynomial centered at . In particular, we'll compute for the numerator.  Let . Then . Therefore, .  Now that we've expanded the numerator in terms of it's straightforward to get our partial fraction decomposition. We simply have .      Taylor's Theorem and Taylor Series  So far, we've seen that Taylor polynomials can provide good approximations to functions near their center. Furthermore, these approximations seem to improve as the order of the Taylor polynomial increases. It's natural to ask if the approximation becomes exact as we let the order go to . Doing so transforms the Taylor polynomial into a Taylor series .   Taylor Series  Taylor series   Let be a function that is infinitely differentiable at . The Taylor series of centered at is . If , we often call the resulting series the Maclaurin series of .    Note that if is the order Taylor polynomial of some infinitely differentiable function , then the Taylor series is given by (assuming this limit exists).   Maclaurin series for the exponential   Find the Maclaurin series for .    Let . As mentioned in , all of the derivatives of at are . Therefore the Maclaurin series is .     gives us the Taylor series about for , but at the moment we don't know if it actually equals . However, if we differentiate the series we get the same series back. In other words, the Taylor series of  is its own derivative , which is a promising sign.   Taylor series for   Assuming that equals its Taylor series, find the Maclaurin series for . Also, find the derivative of at .    We could use to find the Maclaurin series for , but it's far, far easier to use the series for : .  It turns out that this also lets us find derivatives at incredibly quickly. If we let , then it follows that is the coefficient of in the power series for . Therefore .    Not every function with a Taylor series can be represented by its Taylor series. The typical example of this poor behavior is the piecewise function . It can be shown that for all and so the Maclaurin series of must be . However, this series cannot equal except at .  If we want to use Taylor series, then we need to know exactly when a function is equal to its Taylor series. This can be determined with Taylor's Theorem .   Taylor's Theorem (Lagrange's form)   Let be a function that is -times differentiable. Let denote the corresponding Taylor polynomial of order centered at . Then there exists between and such that .     Maclaurin Series for Cosine   Find the Maclaurin series for and show that equals its Maclaurin series for all .    Using , the Taylor series for at is given by . So to find this series we need to find the derivatives of cosine at : and so on. So the Maclaurin series for is given by . In sigma notation, this is . Using the ratio test, we can also show that this series converges for all .  To show that this series actually equals , we need to consider the remainder term . from We don't know what exactly is, except that it's between and . However, we do know that , which means that the remainder satisfies . Therefore equals its Maclaurin series.    Now that we know how to express as a power series, we can do the same for .   Maclaurin Series for Sine   Find the Maclaurin series for .    Knowing a power series representation for a function makes calculus with that function extremely straightforward, at least if you're willing to use series.   Computing a Definite Integral   Use power series to find , and find an approximation within of the exact value.    Using the power series for from , we have . This is an alternating series, so by the alternating series test the partial sum is always within of the exact value. So if we want to get enough terms of the series to be within of the exact value, we need to pick so that , which occurs at . So . This is within about of the exact value.    One extremely useful application of power series in mathematics and its applications is in deriving Euler's Formula .   Euler's Formula   Let . Then .

We'll introduce some notation that will come in handy later: let denote the set of real numbers (also known as scalars ), and let denote the -plane. Then a set of parametric equations describes a function from (specifically, an interval in ) to . We'll see more of this in the following chapters.  Plotting points and plugging them into parametric equations can be tedious. Another way to describe a parametric curve is to eliminate parameters.

  "body": " Polar Coordinates   Introducing Polar Coordinates  We typically use Cartesian or rectangular coordinates to plot points. However, this can lead to issues if we have a graph that isn't rectangular. For example, the circle has a simple geometric description based on its center and radius, but in Cartesian coordinates it can be difficult to work with since every point on the (unit) circle takes the form . This square root makes integrals and derivatives complicated. The main problem lies in the fact that we are trying to describe a circle using a rectangular coordinate system. So our goal in this section is to find a more suitable coordinate system for circles.  A circle can be described as the set of all points some fixed distance from a given point, and we can specify any point on the circle by using an angle :      Using distance and angle to specify a point.   Any point on the circle can be described solely using the distance and the direction . This leads directly to the idea of polar coordinates. In polar coordinates, the -plane is replaced with an -plane, or polar plane . Each point in the polar plane has the form , where the radial coordinate  denotes the distance from the origin, or pole , and the angular coordinate  determines the angle the point makes with the horizontal polar axis . The polar axis replaces the positive -axis from Cartesian coordinates:      The polar plane.   In polar coordinates, positive correspond to counterclockwise direction, and negative correspond to clockwise direction. We also allow for to be negative: this just means go in the direction opposite of .   Plotting polar coordinates  Suppose we want to plot the points and We can do so in the polar plane by remembering that the first coordinate is distance from the pole, and the second coordinate is direction from the polar axis. If we plot these points, we see that and actually represent the same point. This is typical of polar coordinates: every point has, in general, infinitely many representations.       The plot from .     Converting Coordinates  If we want to use polar coordinates, then it'd be helpful to know how to convert between Cartesian (rectangular) coordinates and polar coordinates. The following diagram will help us to make these conversions.      Converting between Cartesian and polar coordinates.   So in terms of , we have   Going in the other direction, the Pythagorean theorem tells us that , while .   Converting polar to Cartesian  Suppose we want to convert the point in polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates . Then we have   and so the Cartesian point is    Converting Cartesian to polar  Suppose we now want to convert the point in Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates. Then finding is relatively straightforward:   Finding requires a bit more care. We know that has to satisfy . One choice that makes this work is . However, this is incorrect! Whatever is needs to be consistent with the fact that our point lies in the second quadrant. So we'll pick instead. Hence one way to write the point in polar coordinates is given by    Converting equations  Consider the polar equation . We can convert this into a Cartesian equation using the above formulas. In particular, we use and . So and the equation becomes      Polar Curves  Now we move on to graphing polar equations.   Graphs of constants in polar coordinates  In Cartesian coordinates, the graphs of and give horizontal and vertical lines, respectively. In polar coordinates, the graphs of and have simple descriptions as well. The graph of is just the set of all points units away from the pole, so it's just a circle of radius centered at the pole. Likewise, the graph of is the set of all points that make an angle of with the polar axis, so it's just a line through the pole.    Graphs from Cartesian equations  In some cases it's beneficial to convert a polar equation to a Cartesian equation. The Cartesian equation may have a recognizable form that helps us to identify the corresponding polar graph. For example, suppose we want to describe the graph of for some constant . Then we can convert it to a Cartesian equation, in particular   If we complete the square, we get , which describes a circle centered at (in the -plane) and with radius . In the polar plane, this is a circle of radius centered at Similarly, describes a circle of radius centered at .    Another circle  Suppose we want to graph . From the previous example, we know that this will be a circle of radius centered at . See the following figure.       The circle from .     Cartesian to Polar Method  Graphing polar equations can be tricky, because it's easy to miss aspects of the graph unless you're careful. A useful method for graphing polar equations involves treating them as Cartesian equations first to get a better sense of how the graph behaves.   Three leaf rose  Suppose we want to graph . We don't know what this looks like in the polar plane yet, but we have a pretty good idea of how it looks when treated as a Cartesian equation in the -plane (which we view as different from the polar plane!):      The graph of as a Cartesian equation.   So we see that at goes from to , decreases from to , hitting along the way at .      to .   Now, as goes from to  will go from to , hitting at :      to .

Consider a region bounded by the polar curve :      The polar region .   To find the area of this region, we'll approximate it using circular sectors. Since we want to find the area between and , we'll break the interval into subintervals of equal length , with       Approximating the region with circular sectors.   The area of each slice is given by   For one of our slices, this takes the form   Adding these areas up gives us the approximate area of the region.

We'll just need three coordinate axes: the -, - and -axes. We typically view the -plane as horizontal, and the -axis as vertical, but there's no mathematical preference either way.  Just as the - and -axes determined the -plane, we can also get the - and -planes. These planes divide space into eight octants .

  "body": " Vectors   One of our goals in this chapter is to adequately describe motion in space. A useful way to do this uses the concept of vector , which we think of as a quantity that has both direction and magnitude\/length. A simple example would be velocity: velocity in space has a direction and also a magnitude (speed). We will typically denote vectors by using boldface letters such as or letters with a bar overhead such as . We represent vectors as arrows with an initial point and a terminal point :      A vector.   We say that two vectors are equivalent , or equal , if they have the same magnitude and direction. We write this as .    Addition and Scalar Multiplication  Given two vectors , we can add them to get the new vector   So the vector is obtained by moving the tail of to the tip of and then drawing a vector from the tail of to the tip of .      Vector addition.   The sum of vectors can be computed using either the triangle law , illustrated above in , or the similar parallelogram law . We can also scale vectors using scalar multiplication : if is a scalar In other words, a number. then is defined to be the vector that has the same direction as if and the opposite direction if , but the magnitude is rescaled by the factor .   Vector subtraction  Using the previous graph, we can compute . We just need to scale the vectors properly and then add to .     Vector Components  Although it isn't too hard to add and scale vectors visually, it'll be beneficial to do the same algebraically. We can do so by breaking a vector down into its components . Consider a vector in in , and suppose if we move it to the origin then the tip of the vector is at the point . Then the components of are and , and we write   Note the use of brackets here, since technically we are saying that the vector is distinct from the point , even though they are closely related. We say that the position vector of a point is the vector whose components are the same as the coordinates of the point. Geometrically, the position vector of a point is the vector with its tail at the origin and its tip at .  So any vector in can be represented using components by . Similarly, any vector in can be represented as . Once you represent a vector in component form, addition and scalar multiplication is straightforward.   Vector addition with components  Let and . Then    Finding magnitudes of vectors can also be done by applying the distance formula from to the components of the vectors. The magnitude of a vector is denoted by or . For example, the magnitude of from the previous example is   Given a vector     A vector equation  We can use vectors to describe curves and surfaces. For example, let and . Let . Then the set of all points that satisfy the equation has a very nice description: it's just the sphere of radius centered at .    Finding components of vectors  Consider the points and . We want to find the components of the vector . We can do this by translating to the origin, which is done by subtracting from each coordinate of the corresponding coordinate of . So the vector is given by    In general, given and the vector is given by    Properties of Vector Addition and Scalar Multiplication  vectors properties of vector addition and scalar multiplication   Let be vectors and let be scalars. Then the following are true:    .                .            Basis Vectors and Unit Vectors  Every vector in can be written using three components: Each component corresponds to a coordinate axis, and we can rewrite as a linear combination of three different vectors, with each vector corresponding to a coordinate axis:  These vectors are important enough that we'll give them a name: the standard basis vectors .  Standard Basis Vectors  vectors standard basis   The standard basis for is the set , where     As we've seen, every vector in can be expressed using only these three vectors. The standard basis has two important properties: it is perpendicular (also called orthogonal ) and every vector in the collection has magnitude . In other words,   These vectors are essentially designed to capture the \"coordinate directions\", and are plotted below.      The standard basis.   This also leads us to our next definition.   Unit Vectors  vectors unit vectors   A vector is a unit vector if .    Unit vectors are useful if we just need to indicate a direction, and we don't care about magnitude. Every nonzero vector can be rescaled to a unit vector: just divide the vector by its norm.   Direction from one point to another  Consider the points and . Then we can find the unit vector indicating the direction from to . First, set   Then the unit vector that gives the direction from to is given by     A vector equation for the unit sphere  Using the concept of a unit vector, we can very easily describe the unit sphere The sphere of radius centered at the origin. using a vector equation. If we set , then the unit sphere is just the set of all solutions of      Applications  Many physical quantities have both a direction and a magnitude, like velocity, acceleration and forces. Vectors are ideally suited to measure these quantities.   Weight of a chain  A still chain is fixed to two ends of a level divide. The tension of the chain at each fixed end can be represented by vectors pointing away from the chain. Call these tension forces and . Suppose we know that each force vector makes an angle of with the ground on either side of the chain's fixed ends, and that the magnitude of each tension is 43 . Then we can use vector addition to find the weight of the chain.  Let denote the weight of the chain considered as a vector (so that it's pointing down). Since the chain is still, its resultant The sum of all forces acting on the chain. must be . So we can say that   or in other words   What we need to find is , which we can do without too much trouble if we can rewrite the tension vectors in component form. In fact, we have   So it follows that   Therefore the chain weighs .    "

Such a measure may be useful for determining if forces are too close together, for example. So consider two vectors and as in the following diagram.      Vector overlap.   One way we can measure how much and overlap is to find , or equivalently since this is larger if and are more closely aligned. We are carefully ignoring the case where and point in opposite directions... From , we know that   This simplifies out to   The only part of this that could possibly depend on how closely and overlap is the middle term . So we'll (optimistically... for now) take what's inside the parentheses and use it as the measure we're looking for.   The Dot Product  dot product definition   Let and . The dot product of with , denoted is given by     The dot product is also sometimes called the scalar product (since it always produces a scalar) or the inner product in other settings.   Computing dot products  Let and . Then   It also doesn't matter what order we take the vectors in for the dot product: we get the same answer regardless. However, it does matter that we only use two vectors. The dot product takes two vectors and gives a scalar. In other words, it is impossible to take the dot product of more than two vectors at a time! So quantities such as are not meaningful.    Properties of the Dot Product  dot product properties   Let and be vectors, and let be a scalar. Then the following properties hold:                     Our goal was to define a measure for how much two given vectors align, or are correlated. The following result tells us that the dot product is actually a reasonable measure of this.   Geometry of the Dot Product  dot product geometry   Let and denote vectors, and let denote the angle between these vectors if the tails of both are moved to the origin. Then      Place both vectors and at the origin, and then draw the vector from the tip of to the tip of , like so:      Geometry of the dot product.   Then and form a triangle. We want to relate the dot product with the angle , so we'll start by using the Law of Cosines to get an equation involving . The Law of Cosines states that   Here's where the dot product comes in. Each squared magnitude can be rewritten as a dot product using , so in particular we have   Plugging this into gives us the following:   Which finally simplifies down to     It's usually easier to use to compute dot products.

The projection can be thought of as the vector parallel to that best approximates . What we'd like to do now is to actually find a formula for this projection.

For example, let and . Then    Remember that we said the cross product is our tool for finding perpendicular vectors. So it might be nice if we made sure it actually did that. As a quick check, we'll compute and , with these vectors coming from . If we do so, we obtain   Since these dot products are zero, this means that both and are perpendicular to the cross product . This is also true in general.   Orthogonality of the Cross Product  cross product orthogonality    is always orthogonal to both and .    So the cross product always produces orthogonal vectors. To determine the direction of the cross product , we use the right-hand rule : sweep your right hand from to and stick your thumb up. Then is parallel to your thumb.  We would also like to know the magnitude of the cross product. We can just compute it using and find the magnitude using our usual formula. If we do so, we obtain (after a lot of simplifying!)   which reduces to the following result.   Magnitude of the Cross Product  cross product magnitude   Let denote the acute angle between the vectors and , so that . Then     So in particular, two nonzero vectors and are parallel (i.e. have ) if and only if .   Testing collinearity  We say that three points and are collinear if they all lie on the same line. Suppose we want to check if the points and are collinear or not. How can we do so? If we start by defining   then we can say that all three points lie on the same line if and only if and are parallel to each other. So we'll compute their cross product to get . Since these vectors are parallel, then the three given points must lie on the same line.   Another important property of the magnitude of the cross product is the following: is exactly equal to the area of the parallelogram determined by and .   Area of a triangle  Suppose that we want the area of the triangle with vertices and . To start, we need to find vectors that determine the triangle. We can use   Now, the triangle determined by and is precisely half of the parallelogram determined by these same vectors, so the area of this triangle is equal to . We can use Sage as in the cell below to find the cross product of these vectors. Doing so, we get So the area of the triangle with vertices and is      Properties of the Cross Product  cross product properties   Let be vectors and a scalar. Then the following properties are true:           The last item above is an important relationship between the cross product and dot product called the scalar triple product . There is an important geometric significance to this new product.   scalar triple product  Geometry of the Scalar Triple Product   Let and be vectors in . Then is equal to the volume of the parallelepiped determined by and .     Testing if vectors are coplanar  We say that three vectors and are coplanar if they can all lie in a single plane. For example, and are coplanar since they lie in the -plane, but and are not coplanar. Suppose we're given and . These vectors are coplanar if and only if the parallelepiped determined by these vectors has zero volume (i.e. is flat). Since   these vectors are not coplanar.    Another way to compute cross products  Using and the facts that   gives us another way to compute cross products that doesn't involve determinants. As an example, let and Then      Torque  Consider a force acting on a rigid body at some position . This force applies a turning affect to the body, that we measure by torque .   Torque  torque   The torque of a force acting at a position is defined to be the vector     As one example of torque, consider a wrench applied to a bolt. The force is exerted at the end of the wrench, and the torque is a vector that's parallel to the axis of rotation of the bolt. The torque is greater if the force is applied at a direction perpendicular (or nearly so) to that of the wrench, and smaller if the force is nearly parallel to the direction of the wrench. As a quick check, the torque is if the force is exactly parallel to the direction of the wrench, which makes sense: if we're pushing or pulling the wrench, the bolt won't rotate at all.   Torque and hex keys  A hex key (Allen wrench) with a short arm of length 27 and a long arm length of 154 is applied to a bolt, with the short arm attached to the bolt. To turn the bolt, a force of 0.5 is applied to the long arm of the hex key turning the bolt counterclockwise when viewed from the positive -axis, and is exactly perpendicular to both the short arm and long arm of the hex key. We want to find the torque of this force on the bolt.  One way we can do this is to imagine the bolt sitting at the origin, and the hex key is (initially) in the -plane. Note that once the force is applied, it will begin to rotate the hex key out of the -plane. Now, the torque is defined by where is the vector from the axis of rotation of the bolt to the point where the force is applied.   If we were using a standard wrench, then we could simply let be the position vector with initial point at the bolt and terminal point at where the force is applied.   We can find without too much trouble: it's . To find the force , note that it's perpendicular to both the long arm and short arm of the bolt. So in order to guarantee counterclockwise rotation of the bolt when viewed from the positive -axis. So the torque is given by     "

In fact, it actually gives a plane, as we'll see! What we want to do now is find exactly how to describe a given line or plane.    Equations of Lines  First, suppose we have a line in as follows:      A line in .   Our goal is to find an equation that describes this line. Imagine that we have a vector pointing from the origin to the point , like so:      Tracing out using vectors.   Then we can get to every other point on the line by starting from . In particular, if is any vector parallel to , then must also be on the line :      Tracing out using vectors.   So to get all possible points on , we just need to look at all possible vectors , where is any vector parallel to . If we set , We don't actually have to pick , we just need to be parallel to . then   will trace out all points on as varies from to .   Parametric Equations of a Line  lines parametric equations in   If is a point on a line , and if is parallel to , then   traces out , where   We can also write this as the system of equations      Equation of a line with a given direction and point  Suppose we want to find the equation of a line that passes through and is perpendicular to . says that we only need to find the right choices for and in order to get the equation of such a line, and we can write down one of these right away:   So we just need to find . Since is orthogonal to , this means we want to be orthogonal to as well. A great way to find such a is to use the cross product. If is any nonzero vector, then must be orthogonal to both and , and in particular it must be orthogonal to . So we can take   So the equation of this line is   As varies, this will trace out our line.   When we begin working with line integrals, we'll need to know how to parameterize a line segment, so we'll discuss that now. Suppose we have a line segment between two points and . Let and denote the corresponding position vectors of these points (i.e. the vectors whose components are given by the coordinates of these points). Then the equation of the line between and is given by   To get the line segment we're actually looking for, we just need to restrict to the interval . So we can say that   traces out the line segment between and .    Equations of Planes  Now we move on to finding the equation of a plane. We'll try a vector approach to this like we did for lines, and this won't be too bad to do. We just need to keep the following in mind:   A plane in is uniquely determined by specifying a single point for it to pass through and a direction for it to face.   So in particular, vectors will provide a nice way to specify the direction of a plane, and any vector that does so must be orthogonal to the plane. If a (nonzero) vector is orthogonal to a given plane, then we call a normal vector to the plane. Now we can build up an equation of a given plane.  Let denote a point on the plane, and let be a normal vector to the plane. If is the position vector of any other point on the plane, then it must be true that , where is the position vector of . We can summarize this in the following theorem.   Vector and Scalar Equations of a Plane  planes vector and scalar equations   If is the position vector for some point on a plane with normal vector , then the position vector of any other point on the plane must satisfy the vector equation of the plane :   Equivalently, any point must also satisfy the equivalent scalar equation of the plane :      Equation of a plane orthogonal to a line  Consider the two lines in determined by the equations   We want to find the equation of the plane that contains the intersection of these two lines and is orthogonal to the first line.

To find it, we'll set and go from there:   So the position vector of the point where these lines intersect is given by . We also need a normal vector to the plane, but this is easy to find: since the plane needs to be orthogonal to the first line, we can just take . So the equation of our plane is   or equivalently   This plane is plotted below using the Sage cell immediately after this example.    We can rewrite the equation of a plane in the form   A normal vector to this plane is given by .

The cylinder     Another cylinder  Consider the cylinder given by the set of all lines passing through the plane curve in the -plane and parallel to the line in defined by the equation   What does this cylinder look like? Well, we can view it as essentially a \"sheet\" of lines cutting through the -plane at the line . If we try to imagine this, then this suggests that this cylinder should probably be a plane!

Vector functions are functions of the form and graphs of vector functions are called space curves . We call the component functions of . We're interested in how these curves change, which means we're interested in how to do calculus on space curves. Although these curves live in , there's still only one independent variable: . So much of what we learned in Calculus I applies to space curves.    Limits with Space Curves  We can take limits with vector functions just as we can with regular functions.  Let . Then   In other words, if you want to take the limit of a vector function you can just take the limits of the component functions.   Limit of a vector function  Let   Suppose we want to find . Then we just need to take the limit of each component. So    Just as in Calculus I, we say that a vector function is continuous at if . In general, a vector function is continuous wherever all of its components functions are continuous.   A horiztonal helix  Let , and suppose we want to sketch this function. One way to do so is to plug in values for and connect the resulting points with a curve, but we can also do the following to get an idea of what this looks like. First, note that we have and . So , which means that this looks like the unit circle in the -plane, traced clockwise . Since we also have , this curve moves farther along the -axis as increases. If we trace this out, we get a helix (see the below plot). We can also see from the graph that it has no jumps or gaps, so is continuous everywhere.     Finding vector functions  Consider the cylinder and the surface , and suppose we want to trace out there intersection with a vector function. Here's how we can do this. First, we'll come up with the and components of . Since , this suggests that we should take   So that's two down, one to go. To get , we just need to use the equation . So   So our vector function is   This is also plotted below.      Derivatives with Space Curves  Now that we know how to take limits with vector functions, we can take derivatives as well.   Derivatives of Vector Functions  vector functions derivatives   Let denote a vector function. The derivative of is the new vector function given by   assuming that the limit exists. If this limit exists, we say that is differentiable .    If then is differentiable if and only if are, and Just as in Calculus I, the derivative represents how quickly a space curve is changing at some value of . However, derivatives of vector functions also carry information about the direction a curve is moving. We call the tangent vector to . In particular, is parallel to the space curve at , and its magnitude represents how quickly the curve is changing at . If we only care about direction, then we can define the unit tangent  , which is given by   We also have the usual ideas from Calculus I and physics regarding motion: velocity is the derivative of position and acceleration is the derivative of velocity.   Velocity on a saddle  A particle moves counterclockwise along the \"saddle\" . We want its velocity at . First, find to get   At , we have the velocity vector   So at the point , the space curve is parallel to the vector . In other words, the particle is moving in this direction at .

Vector Derivative Rules  vector functions derivative rules   Let and be differentiable vector functions, be a scalar and let be a differentiable (scalar) function. Then the following formulas hold:              Integrals with Space Curves  We can also integrate vector functions without too much trouble. Just as taking the derivative of a vector function reduces down to differentiating each component, integrating a vector function reduces down to integrating each component. If then    "

  "body": " Arc Length and Curvature   Arc Length  Suppose some particle travels along the space curve given by for . What we'd like to do is determine how far the particle travels over this time interval. Recall that distance is just speed multiplied by time, and the speed of this particle is given by . So we can imagine that the distance traveled by this particle over some infinitesimal time interval to be given by . So adding up all of these distances from to should give us the arc length. This suggests (but does not prove!) the following formula for arc length:    gives the length of the space curve from to , assuming that the integral exists.   Arc length of a helix  Suppose we want to find the arc length of the helix from to . Then this is given by    One thing we'd like to do now is to parametrize a space curve with respect to arc length. Here's what we mean by this: given some with , we define its arc length function  by   If we can then solve for in terms of , this parametrizes the curve in terms of the arc length variable .   Reparametrizing a space curve  Suppose we're given the space curve   which starts at , (so starts at ) and we want to find the point that is units along the curve in the positive direction. Then we can do this by reparametrizing the curve using arc length. Here's how. First, we find the arc length function :   Since , we get . So   reparametrizes the space curve in terms of arc length. So the point on the curve that is units along in the positive direction is given by       Curvature  What we want to do now is measure how much a curve \"turns\" at some point. First, we call a space curve  smooth on some interval if for any in . Now, if we want to measure how quickly a curve is changing direction then we can use the unit tangent vector to measure this. In particular, the derivative of the unit tangent should provide a good measure of how quickly a curve turns. However, we don't want to let the specific parametrization of the curve affect this; in other words, the rate at which a curve is turning should not depend on the speed at which the curve is traveled. This leads to the following definition.   vector functions curvature  Curvature   Let denote a smooth curve on some interval . The curvature of on is defined to be the function given by   where is the unit tangent to the curve.     Computing a curvature  Consider the curve We'll try to find the curvature by making use of . First, we need to find so we can take its derivative:   Therefore   So the curvature is given by     Using curvature  Consider the curve once again. We'll try to find where this curve turns the fastest. To do this, we look at the curvature we found from :   This curve is turning the fastest precisely where the curvature is largest, and this happens at .   We can use to compute curvatures, but we've seen that it can be pretty awful. So we'd like to use another formula if we can; thankfully, there is another option.   vector functions curvature alternative formula  Alternative Curvature Formula   The curvature of in is given by     The formula in may look worse than the formula given in , but it has one significant advantage: we don't need to differentiate any magnitudes, which is required in the previous formula to compute .   Using the alternative formula   Let . We'll make use of to find We have   and so       Normal and Binormal Vectors  Consider a curve . Then the direction of the curve is given by the unit tangent vector . If we differentiate to get , we can view this vector as telling us the direction the curve is turning. This leads us to the concept of unit normal vectors to a space curve.   vector functions unit normal vector  Unit Normal Vectors   Consider a space curve given by . The unit normal vector is the vector given by   where is the derivative of the unit tangent vector.     Unit normal on a circle   Find the unit normal vector of the curve given by .    If we think of a particle moving along , then this particle is just moving along the unit circle. So at every point along this path, the particle should be turning toward the origin in order to stay on the unit circle. So at all points of the curve, should point towards the origin. To prove this, we'll use the formula above to find the unit normal:   So . So at every point of the circle, the unit normal points in the opposite direction of the corresponding position vector, i.e. it points towards the origin.    It's not clear from , but is always orthogonal to for any space curve\/vector function . We can use these two vectors to get another vector called the binormal vector .   vector functions binormal vector  Binormal Vector   Let be a vector function with unit tangent and unit normal . Then the unit binormal vector is the vector given by      "

In general, showing limits exist for functions of several variables can be tricky. However, occasionally we can use some tricks to make these problems more manageable.   Showing a limit exists   Find .    Since the inside of the limit depends on , this suggests that switching to polar coordinates might be beneficial. So let's try that! Here's why this helps us. If we look at our new limit, we see that it doesn't depend on at all. In other words, it doesn't depend on the direction we approach the origin from, just the distance from the origin . So and so the original limit also equals .

When computing partial derivatives with respect to , you just need to differentiate treating it as a function of alone and considering as a constant. Similarly, if you want to compute you differentiate with respect to and treat as constant.    Let . Find .

To put this another way, gives the rate of change of in the direction of the vector , and gives the rate of change in the direction of the vector . But we have infinitely many directions to work with. How can we find the rate of change of in any direction? We'll look at two tools to help us with this: directional derivatives and gradients.    The Directional Derivative  Suppose we have a function defined at a point . We want to find how quickly is changing in the direction of some unit vector . We can estimate this by moving from the point by some small increment , and evaluating at this new point, which is just . So the approximate rate of change in in the direction of is given by As , this should become exact. This leads us to our next definition.   directional derivative definition  Directional Derivative   The directional derivative of the function at the point in the direction of the vector is given by assuming this limit exists. As we mentioned above, and .    We have a definition for the directional derivative, but we don't want to have to use this all the time. So we'd like to get a more practical formula.   directional derivative formula  Computing the Directional Derivative   Let be a function whose partial derivatives and exist and are continuous. Let be a unit vector. Then exists, and is given by     First, set Then by the Calculus I definition of the derivative, On the other hand, if we set and , then .

Computing a directional derivative   Let . Find the directional derivative of in the direction of at the point .    We can use to find the directional derivative. However, there's something we need to watch out for here. Both and require using a unit vector , but our vector isn't a unit vector at all. So we need to normalize  to get a unit vector that is parallel to : Since we see that the directional derivative we need is given by       Gradients   shows that the partial derivatives of a function are important in computing the directional derivatives.

  "body": " Extreme Values   Finding the extreme values of a function remains in important goal for functions of several independent variables.    Local Maxima and Minima  One of the most important applications of the derivative in Calculus I is in finding local maxima and minima of functions . We'd like to extend this concept to functions of multiple variables, but first we need to define what local maxima and minima actually are in this new setting.   maxima and minima local  Local Maxima and Minima   We say that a function has a local maximum (respectively, local minimum) at if (respectively, ) for all points contained in some disk centered at .    Just as we used derivatives in Calculus I to find maxima and minima, we can use partial derivatives for that purpose here.   Derivatives at a Local Maximum or Minimum   Suppose that is differentiable, and has a local maximum or minimum at . Then      does not tell us if a differentiable function has a local maximum or minimum at , but it does tell us where to look. We call a critical point of if or if these partial derivatives fail to exist at .   Critical points of an exponential   Let . Find its critical points.    Find the critical points by solving and . Since then forces . Similarly, since then forces or . So the only points that satisfy both  and are So these must be our critical points.    We found the critical points in without too much trouble, but these are still not guaranteed to be local maxima or minima. To determine if they are, we need to use the second derivative test .   maxima and minima second derivative test  Second Derivative Test   Let be a differentiable function with continuous second partial derivatives, and let be a critical point of . Define to be Then we have the following possibilities:  If and , then is a local minimum.  If and , then is a local maximum.  If , then is a neither a local minimum nor local maximum. In this case we call a saddle point .  If , the test is inconclusive.      The quantity from is actually a determinant:    Local extrema of an exponential   Classify the critical points of the function from .    We have , and the critical points are and . We need to find . Since , we get and similarly At , we have and as well. So this is a local minimum. At , we still have , but now . So this is a local maximum.      Absolute Maxima and Minima  Even if a function has a local minimum at , there's no guarantee that this is the smallest value the function can take on its domain. A similar statement is also true for local maxima, which leads to the following definition.   maxima and minima absolute  Absolute Maxima and Minima   Let be a function defined on the set . We call the point an absolute minimum (respectively, absolute maximum ) if (respectively, ) for all points in .    As a first example, consider , which gives the top half of the unit sphere. Using critical points and the second derivative test, we can show that the origin is a local maximum. However, this method is blind to the absolute minimum values of , which occur at the boundary , where the sphere intersects the -plane. So this means we can't use critical points alone to find absolute maxima and minima, in general. However, the following theorem says that they'll get us most of the way there.   Extreme Value Theorem functions of several variables  Extreme Value Theorem   Let be a continuous function defined on a closed and bounded set . This means that is finite in size and that it includes its boundary. Then is guaranteed to have an absolute maximum and absolute minimum. Furthermore, these must occur either at a critical point or on the boundary of .     Absolute values on a triangle   Let . Find the absolute maxima and minima of on the triangle with vertices and .    We'll start off by finding any critical points. Since , we see that the only critical point is . Now we need to see what happens to on the edges of the triangle, and to do that we need to find equations for the edges. Let denote the edge from to , the edge from to and the edge from to . Then is given by the equation , is given by and is given by . So on we have , on we have and on we have . We can then set up the following table:   Absolute values on the boundary    edge   max  min                       Finally, at the critical point we have . So putting this all together, we can say that the absolute maximum of on this triangle is , and this is reached at . Similarly, the absolute minimum is , and this is reached at the origin.    Note that in , we don't actually determine if the critical point is a local maximum or minimum. We just compare the value reaches at the critical point with its maximum and minimum values on the boundary.   Absolute maxima and minima on a circular sector   Let and let Find the absolute maxima and minima of on .    First we'll find the critical point(s). If we compute , we get .

Geometrically, this reduces down to finding the maximum and minimum values of on the curve . This problem can be attacked algebraically using contours, as in the example below.   Constrained Optimization Using Contours   Estimate the minimum and maximum values of subject to the constraint .    The constraint is represented as a contour plot of . We can compare this with contours of , and any point where there two contours intersect is a point for which the constraint is satisfied.   An interactive contour plot of and .    Using these contours, we see that the maximum value of subject to appears to be , while the minimum value of subject to appears to be .    Although the graphical approach used in and specifically in is useful for estimating solutions of constrained optimization problems in two dimensions, it's neither exact nor easy to visualize in higher dimensions. We therefore want to determine an algebraic approach for solving these problems. In these cases, is not as useful because there's no guarantee that the critical points of will lie on the curve . For this scenario, we must use the method of Lagrange multipliers .   Lagrange multipliers  Method of Lagrange Multipliers   Suppose that and are both differentiable functions, and suppose that on the curve . To find the extreme values of subject to the constraint , perform the following steps:  Find all points such that , where is a constant we call the Lagrange multiplier .  Compute at all points from the first step and compare values to find any maxima or minima.        Maximizing volume   A lidless box may be made from 12 of material. What dimensions give the maximum volume?    If we denote the dimensions of the box by , then the function we need to maximize is . However, not all dimensions are valid since we're only allowed to use 12 of material. This means that the surface area of the box, which is given by , must be equal to . So our constraint is that , and because we have this constraint we'll try to solve this using .  To begin, we need to solve . Equivalently, we need to solve the system which turns into Now, we don't actually need to find a value for . We just need values for . If we multiply these equations by , and respectively, then we get or just We can also divide by , since there's no way could equal and satisfy the above equations (since are all positive). This gives us   The first two expressions in simplify to , while the first and third reduce to . So . But these variables also need to satisfy : Therefore , so we take (since we're dealing with dimensions). This also means that . So the point is therefore our candidate for the dimensions that maximize volume subject to the constraint .  In order to actually verify that is actually the largest possible volume we can obtain, we need to show that it's actually a maximum and not a minimum. This means we need to find another point that also satisfies , and show that it gives a smaller value for . One such point is just , and . So is actually a maximum value and not a minimum value.    The points we'll obtain using Lagrange multipliers will be either maxima or minima, but the method itself doesn't always tell us which is which.

However, we can steal an idea from Calculus I and try to approximate the volume by using simpler shapes; in this case, rectangular prisms.    Riemann sums.  Given a continuous function defined over the rectangle to approximate the volume under and above we'll divide the rectangle up into smaller rectangles.

  "body": " Double integrals over general regions    shows how to define the double integral over a rectangle . Now we want to extend it to more general regions. We'll be skipping an issue with how to actually define such an integral in terms of Riemann sums, but the main idea is to take a function defined over some general region and then extend it to cover a rectangular region . Then we can just use to define this new integral as well.  Our primary tool for computing double integrals will still be . The main difficulty we'll encounter (aside from the usual integration issues) is how to properly set up limits for and for some region .    Integrating over a region defined by a parabola   Let and let be the region under the parabola , above the -axis and between and . Find .    The first step is to determine limits for and that describe this region. One possible description is the following: If we use this, we can write   We also could have described as the set of all points If we do this instead, we get By , this is guaranteed to equal . However, the actual process of computing the double integral using this choice for the limits is much more difficult, since we would need to integrate with respect to .    There are several important things we can take away from the above example:  Much of the difficulty in computing double integrals lies in finding limits that describe the region you're integrating over. In general, it's a good idea to sketch the region you're integrating over in order to figure out what your limits should be.  There can be multiple ways to describe a single region. This leads to multiple ways of setting up limits for double integrals over this region. If the integrand is continuous, then guarantees that these different methods will all produce the same value.  It's important to choose limits in such a way as to make computing the double integral more manageable.  When finding limits for a double integral, the outermost limits must be constant since the double integral must eventually simplify to a constant. In other words, we don't really have a notion of an \"indefinite\" double integral.     Reversing the order of integration   Compute .    If we try to integrate with respect to right away, then we're stuck: has no elementary antiderivative, which for us means that we can only integrate it using power series. However, it is continuous, so tells us that if we can integrate it with respect to first and then (i.e. replace with ), we'll still get the same answer. And integrating with respect to is actually very easy. This is called reversing the order of integration .  In order to change the order of integration, we need to change the limits. The region we're integrating over is the region If we sketch this, we see that this is just the region below the line , above the -axis and bounded from to . So we can also write Therefore     Sometimes, the order of integration can be chosen to make the limits of integration easier to set up.   Integrating over a triangle   Integrate over the triangle with vertices and .    If we wanted to integrate with respect to first, we would have to break our double integral up into two different double integrals. This is because the limits for change halfway up the triangle. So it'd be better for us to integrate with respect to first. Since we have     Besides finding volumes, we can also use double integrals to find areas. If is some region in the -plane, then represents the volume under the surface and above . This is a solid with the constant height of , so the volume should be equal to the area of times . That is, is equal to the area of .  "

In , the transformation was just .  So the goal behind integrating with change of variables is to find relate the integral , where is in the -plane, to a new integral , where is in the -plane. The main issue with such a transformation is one that we're familiar with from working with polar coordinates: in the first set of coordinates is not necessarily equal to in the new set of coordinates. In general we'll need a scaling factor that depends on and . As it turns out, the proper scaling factor comes from a determinant.

If the density is a constant then this is simple: the mass is just where denotes the length of the wire.  Now suppose that the density varies, and is now a function .

The scalar line integral of along is the number defined to be .   An analogous definition holds for curves in . We can also replace the assumption that is smooth with the assumption that is rectifiable , which (roughly) means it has a well-defined length.     Geometrically, represents the area under and above .  If is nice enough (i.e., piecewise smooth), we can avoid using Riemann sums to compute the scalar line integral.

Therefore     Line integrals along piecewise smooth curves can be found without too much trouble.

Find the average value of on .    The average value of on is given by where and . Therefore has an average value of on .      Vector field line integrals  Suppose we have a force field  in and some particle that is acted upon by the force. The particle has a trajectory given by a curve .  Trajectory in a force field.       We want to determine how the trajectory of the particle aligns with the forcefield . We can do this by picking an arbitrary point along , finding the unit tangent at this point, and then comparing the direction of and that of by computing the dot product . This is a measure of how and align at a specific point, and integrating this along should tell us how and align overall.   line integrals vector fields  Line integral of a vector field    vector line integral of over    Let denote a smooth curve and let be a vector field continuous on . Then we define the line integral of over to be .   This integral is also sometimes called the circulation integral of along .     To find line integrals of vector fields, we proceed as follows. Suppose that . Then . We can also write this as , assuming that .  In addition to measuring how well and align, vector field line integrals can also represent work done.   Flow along a circle   Let denote the segment of the parabola traversed once from to , and let . Does tend to flow with or against ?    If we graph and , we get the following:  Flow over .        suggests that flows with , and we can verify this by computing : . Since the result is positive, this tells us that tends to flow with .     A nonconservative force   Let denote a force field. Is the force conservative?    Here we are using the physical definition of a conservative force, namely that the work done must be path independent . So we'll choose two paths between two points and find the work done on each path. Let the first path, , denote the top half of the unit circle traversed counterclockwise. Similarly, let the second path, , denote the bottom half of the unit circle traversed clockwise. Then both paths have the same initial and terminal points.  From , it appears as though , which suggests that the vector field is path dependent.  A rotating force field.     To verify this, we'll compute the appropriate line integrals.  For , the total circulation is . Likewise, the circulation of along is .  Since the work done by between the points and clearly depends on the path taken between the points, this means that is path dependent and, therefore, not conservative.    We can also compute vector field line integrals in with essentially the same formula.   Circulation in   Find the circulation of along .    We have . Since the circulation is positive, this also shows that tends to flow with .      Flux integrals  The circulation integral in is useful for measuring how much a vector field flows along a given curve. Now, we want to measure how a vector field flows across a curve, at least in .  Given a smooth curve with unit tangent , recall that measures how well a vector field and align at a point on . By integrating this, we get a measure along the entire curve. So if we want to get a sense of how flows across , we can do so by looking at a single point and then integrating along the curve again.  To do this, let be the unit normal vector to , given in . Then determines how flows across at a specific point, and integrating provides a measure along the entire curve. But there's one slight issue: if is a closed curve then it's possible that points into the region enclosed by . We would like to measure how flows out of instead, so we'll replace with , the outward unit normal . This leads us to the flux integral .   line integrals flux integral  Flux integral    flux of over    Let denote a smooth curve and let be a vector field continuous on . Then we define the flux integral of across to be , where is the outward unit normal vector to .    At this point it may be helpful to introduce some new notation. If is a closed curve, then we often denote line integrals involving with instead of .   Flux across the unit circle   Let and let denote the unit circle, traversed exactly once counterclockwise. What is ?    We should have .    In order to actually compute flux integrals, we need to write using . So suppose that is traced out by the vector function . Then must be perpendicular to the unit tangent or equivalently . Our primary tool for finding perpendicular vectors, the cross product, only applies in . So to find we'll (temporarily) move everything into . Now we need to find a vector orthogonal to that also lies in the -plane. This can be done by computing .  At this point we need to decide which direction we want our normal vector to go. We'll usually choose the first option if is traversed counterclockwise and the second option otherwise. Assuming counterclockwise orientation, we have . Now moving back down to , we can write the outward unit normal as .  Therefore .   Verifying the flux   Compute the flux integral in .

We want to extend this result to line integrals of vector fields over curves. In particular, we want to prove a relationship of the form where and are the endpoints of the curve . This is the content of the main result in this section: .    Path independence  Unless otherwise mentioned, we'll assume that we're always working with an open, simply connected domain  . This is a region that, roughly, does not contain its boundary and does not contain any holes. A curve contained in is closed if its initial and terminal points are the same. We'll denote the boundary of by .  Unless mentioned otherwise, we assume is traversed counterclockwise is is in the -plane.  We often denote line integrals over closed curves using the symbol .  The mathematical definition of a conservative vector field is that it's the gradient of some scalar function.   conservative vector field mathematical definition  Conservative vector fields (mathematical definition)   Let be a vector field. We say that is conservative on a domain if on for some scalar function .    However, we also have a physical definition! Which may be useful. This definition relies on the concept of path independence .   vector fields path independence  Path independence   A vector field is path independent on a domain if for any piecewise smooth paths in with the same endpoints. Equivalently, is path independent if for any piecewise smooth closed curve in .     Conservative vector fields (physical definition)  conservative vector field physical definition   Let denote a (vector) force field. We say that is conservative on a domain if is path independent on .    In physical terms, says that the work done by a conservative force on a particle moving along a path depends only on the initial and terminal points of the path. Equivalently, the work done on a closed path must always be .

Using potential to find work done   Let be a force field and let denote the parabolic arc from to . Find the work done by along .    The work done is just . Note that , and so the work done is just by .      Conservative vector fields   shows that line integrals involving conservative vector fields are straightforward to evaluate if we know a corresponding potential function. So now we want to do two things:   Given a vector field , determine if it's conservative.      Given a conservative vector field , determine a potential function .     For the first, we can use our intuition that conservative vector fields shouldn't rotate. So let's assume that is a (differentiable) vector field on and let be a point in the plane. We can estimate the rotation, or circulation , of at by constructing a rectangle with length and height at and measuring how flows counterclockwise around the rectangle. If we do so, then we can estimate the circulation along each side as follows: . Therefore the total circulation near should be about . If we divide by to normalize, then we can say that the circulation is about .

Hence .    The quantity in is called the (two-dimensional) curl of and is denoted by . This represents the tendency of to rotate counterclockwise around a given point. This can be extended to three dimensions using the following formula: where . The direction of provides the axis of rotation at a point, and its magnitude is the tendency of to rotate counterclockwise around this axis of rotation (viewed head on).   Testing a vector field in   Let . Determine if is conservative.   This is taken from Example 2 on page 1165 of Thomas' Calculus , edition.     We need to check if . So we compute this like a cross product, giving . Hence the vector field is irrotational and therefore conservative.    So now we have a good test for if a vector field is conservative. Next, we want to be able to find a corresponding potential function to a conservative vector field.  Consider the vector field from . We know this is conservative, so there must exist a corresponding potential function such that . To find this, we start by noting that whatever is, its partial derivatives must be the components of .

  "body": " Curl and Divergence   In this section we look at two different analogues of the derivative for vector fields. Once we have these versions of the derivative, we'll also be able to state a corresponding version of the , just as the corresponds to the gradient.    Curl  In we introduced the operator, which in is given by . In this class, has no meaning when by itself. However, it gains meaning when multiplied by a scalar function , leaving the gradient . We also used it to define the curl , which we repeat below.   vector fields curl in  Curl of a Vector Field in   Let be a vector field in with continuously differentiable components. The curl of is the vector .    We've already seen a couple nice properties of curls. First, the curl vector gives the axis of rotation about which tends to rotate counterclockwise when viewed head on, and is a measure of the amount of rotation. Second, the curl can be used to determine if a vector field is conservative or not.   Conservative Vector Fields in   Let denote a continuously differentiable vector field on an open set containing the simply connected region . Then is conservative if and only if .     Determining Rotation in a Vector Field   Suppose the vector field represents a swirling fluid. Within this fluid you place a small paddle wheel at the point . When viewed from directly above, will the paddle wheel tend to rotate clockwise or counterclockwise?    First we need to get a measure of the rotation of , so we compute the curl: , which is just at our point. This provides the axis around which the paddle wheel rotates counterclockwise. And since , the paddle wheel does not appear to rotate at all when viewed from above.      Divergence  Our second notion of derivative for vector fields is the divergence . If is a continuously differentiable vector field, then we define the divergence of to be the scalar function given by . The divergence of a vector field is a measure of outflow minus inflow . If , then we say that is incompressible or solenoidal (just as we say that is irrotational if ).   Divergence on a Rectangle   Let and let denote the unit circle, traversed counterclockwise once. Find the divergence of at and . Then find the net divergence of through the interior of .    At , . At this particular point, outflow is balanced with inflow. Likewise, at we can see that inflow is greater than outflow.  We can compute the net divergence as , where is the interior of the unit circle. This is equal to , which means the net flow throughout is . By , this is also equal to the net flux across .      Laplacian  From the divergence we get another useful form of (second) derivative for scalar functions. First, let be a differentiable scalar function. Then we can compute its gradient . This is a vector field that represents how changes. Now, since is a vector field we can also consider its curl and divergence. If is nice enough we know that , which is not particularly useful in this case. But if we take the divergence, we get .   Laplacian  Laplacian   Let be a twice differentiable scalar function on . The Laplacian of is the function given by .     extends to other dimensions in the obvious way. The Laplacian is useful since it provides a measure of how a function's value at a point differs from the average value at nearby points.   Laplacians and Average Values   Let and let . Let denote the unit circle traversed once counterclockwise. Find the average values of on , their specific values at and the Laplacians at .    If we compute the average values, we get . Furthermore, . We also have and .    To see how the Laplacian can arise, consider the following situation explained in Evans' Partial Differential Equations , edition. We have some density function ; this could be mass density, charge density, etc. Now we'll let denote the flux of . It's often reasonable to assume that the flux is proportional to the negative of the gradient of : where . This means that the quantity flows from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration. If represents a quantity in equilibrium within some region , then the net flux across should be . In terms of , we have .  Now we'll make the argument that since the above should be true for arbitrary subregions of . But , which means that .  We say that a function is harmonic if its Laplacian is . The equation is known as Laplace's equation . Harmonic functions are extremely useful, as they represent quantities in a kind of equilibrium state. If represents chemical concentration, temperature or electrostatic potential, then Laplace's equation is Fick's law of diffusion, Fourier's law of heat conduction or Ohm's law of electrical conduction, respectively. See Evans text for more.  Laplacians also appear in certain integral identities.   Green's First Identity  Green's First Identity   Let denote a simply connected region with piecewise smooth boundary . Suppose that is continuously differentiable and is twice continuously differentiable on an open domain containing . Then .    Since the right hand side involves a flux integral, this suggests that may prove useful. Applying this to gives .  Now, recall that is a kind of derivative operator. For this reason, it also satisfies a version of the product rule: . Plugging this into the double integral and rearranging proves the result.      acts as a kind of integration by parts in higher dimensions.     SUGGESTED PROBLEMS: 1-9 odd, 10, 11-15 odd.   "

As before, our computations depend on the specific parameterization we choose.    Parameterizing Surfaces  A curve is a one-dimensional object, and so our parameterizations typically involved only one independent variable. A surface is fundamentally a two-dimensional object, and so we expect its parameterizations to involve two independent variables even if the surface is in . We will use vector functions of the form to represent our parameterizations.   Finding a Surface   Find the surface traced out by in .    For any point on this surface, we know that and .

The reason we care about smooth surfaces above is that they let us specify a normal vector to that surface. There are typically two choices for such a normal vector (inside vs. outside), but once we choose a direction the normal vector becomes ambiguous. Such surfaces are said to be orientable , and it's these surfaces that we can do calculus on.  As an example of a surface that is not orientable, consider the surface parameterized by for and . After a lot of algebra, we find that the normal vector should be .  Here's the problem: the normal vector is different at compared with since the component gets its sign flipped.

  "body": " GNU Free Documentation License  Version 1.3, 3 November 2008  Copyright copyright 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. < >  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.   0. PREAMBLE  The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document free in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.  This License is a kind of copyleft , which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.  We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.    1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS  This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The Document , below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as you . You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.  A Modified Version of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and\/or translated into another language.  A Secondary Section is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.  The Invariant Sections are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.  The Cover Texts are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.  A Transparent copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not Transparent is called Opaque .  Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and\/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.  The Title Page means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, Title Page means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.  The publisher means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public.  A section Entitled XYZ means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as Acknowledgements , Dedications , Endorsements , or History .) To Preserve the Title of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section Entitled XYZ according to this definition.  The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.    2. VERBATIM COPYING  You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.  You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.    3. COPYING IN QUANTITY  If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.  If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.  If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.  It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.    4. MODIFICATIONS  You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:   Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.  List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.  State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.  Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.  Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.  Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.  Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.  Include an unaltered copy of this License.  Preserve the section Entitled History , Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled History in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.  Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the History section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.  For any section Entitled Acknowledgements or Dedications , Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and\/or dedications given therein.  Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.  Delete any section Entitled Endorsements . Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.  Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled Endorsements or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.  Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.  You may add a section Entitled Endorsements , provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.  You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.  The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.    5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS  You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.  The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.  In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled History in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled History ; likewise combine any sections Entitled Acknowledgements , and any sections Entitled Dedications . You must delete all sections Entitled Endorsements .    6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS  You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.  You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.    7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS  A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an aggregate if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.  If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.    8. TRANSLATION  Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.  If a section in the Document is Entitled Acknowledgements , Dedications , or History , the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.    9. TERMINATION  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.    10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE  The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See .  Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License or any later version applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.    11. RELICENSING  Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site (or MMC Site ) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A Massive Multiauthor Collaboration (or MMC ) contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.  CC-BY-SA means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.  Incorporate means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.  An MMC is eligible for relicensing if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.  The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.    ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents  To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:  Copyright (C) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and\/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \"GNU Free Documentation License\".  If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the with Texts. line with this:  with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.  If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.  If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.
