One thing that can make this method tricky is the fact that we can have many different choices for <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(dv\text{;}\)</span> the only thing we need for certain is for <span class="process-math">\(u\,dv = x\sin x\)</span> here. However, if we look at the formula <a href="section-integration-by-parts.html#equation-integration-by-parts" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/equation-integration-by-parts.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Equation 7.1.1">(7.1.1)</a> then we’ll see two new terms on the right hand side: <span class="process-math">\(du\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\text{,}\)</span> together in the second integral. This means that we’ll need to differentiate <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and integrate <span class="process-math">\(v\text{,}\)</span> and this will suggest what both should be.</div>
<div class="para">Since we need to compute <span class="process-math">\(du\text{,}\)</span> then we want <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> to be easy to differentiate. Similarly, we want <span class="process-math">\(dv\)</span> to be easy to integrate. And since we’d like to be able to compute this integral, we’d also like <span class="process-math">\(v\,du\)</span> to be simpler than <span class="process-math">\(u\,dv\text{.}\)</span> Now return to <span class="process-math">\(x\sin x\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> gets simpler if we differentiate it by <span class="process-math">\(\sin x\)</span> doesn’t, this suggests that we should set <span class="process-math">\(u = x\text{.}\)</span> And since <span class="process-math">\(u = x\text{,}\)</span> we must have <span class="process-math">\(dv = \sin x\,dx\)</span> (since <span class="process-math">\(dv\)</span> automatically becomes whatever is left over). With these choices, we have</div>
